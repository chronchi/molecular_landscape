    "section": "",
    "text": "Currently in the clinics estrogen receptor (ER) status is treated as dichotomous condition. Either a breast cancer (BC) is ER positive (ER+) or ER negative (ER-). The threshold for ER+ cells usually is 1% or 10% of the cells positive in a IHC staining. The idea is that ER+ BC patients will receive endocrine therapy, usually tamoxifen or some aromatase inhibitor, for treatment. The problem is not all patients respond the same to these drugs and they also have different proportions of ER+ cells.\nIn this document we show how leveraging molecular information distinguishes ER+ BC patients and how one should look more carefully on ER status. In order to do this, estrogen related signatures: estrogen response early and late from MSigDB(Subramanian et al. 2005) and \\(SET_{ER/PR}\\)(Sinn et al. 2019), are used to calculate scores for each BC patient. These scores then are used to calculate associations with survival analysis. When performing cox regression, we try to adjust for sensible covariates in order to reduce bias. Even though we are adjusting, it is very difficult to know if a covariate is missing in the regression. Thus, care should be always taken when interpreting these results.\nThis chapter is structure in the following way. First section corresponds to loading the datasets and then filtering them. Estrogen signatures scores are calculated using GSVA (Hänzelmann, Castelo, and Guinney 2013). Given the scores, cox regression can be performed adjusting for clinical variables. After this the Hazard ratios can be computed and interpreted along with their confidence intervals."

According to their paper, the score is calculated in the following way:\n\\[\nSET_{ER/PR} = \\sum_{i = 1}^{18} \\frac{T_i}{18} - \\sum_{j=1}^{10}\\frac{R_j}{10} + 2\n\\]\nWhere \\(T_i\\) are the expression levels of target genes and \\(R_j\\) are the expression levels of the reference genes. Here we use GSVA to calculate the scores, even when using their genes.\n\n\n\nBefore we calculate any score, let us check the number of genes available for each pathway in each dataset. This is important, in other to have robust scores, most of the genes should be available in the datasets. We also add signatures of 18 and 200 random genes for control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    pathway \n    tcga \n    scanb \n    metabric \n    n \n    average_percentage \n  \n \n\n  \n    HALLMARK_ADIPOGENESIS \n    188 \n    187 \n    164 \n    210 \n    0.86 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_ALLOGRAFT_REJECTION \n    141 \n    134 \n    139 \n    335 \n    0.41 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_ANDROGEN_RESPONSE \n    93 \n    92 \n    83 \n    102 \n    0.88 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_ANGIOGENESIS \n    30 \n    29 \n    28 \n    36 \n    0.81 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_APICAL_JUNCTION \n    155 \n    148 \n    151 \n    231 \n    0.66 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_APICAL_SURFACE \n    31 \n    30 \n    31 \n    46 \n    0.67 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_APOPTOSIS \n    141 \n    141 \n    130 \n    183 \n    0.75 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_BILE_ACID_METABOLISM \n    75 \n    71 \n    77 \n    114 \n    0.65 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_CHOLESTEROL_HOMEOSTASIS \n    67 \n    67 \n    60 \n    77 \n    0.84 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_COAGULATION \n    92 \n    90 \n    88 \n    162 \n    0.56 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_COMPLEMENT \n    152 \n    149 \n    144 \n    237 \n    0.63 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_DNA_REPAIR \n    145 \n    144 \n    127 \n    170 \n    0.82 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_E2F_TARGETS \n    196 \n    179 \n    174 \n    218 \n    0.84 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_EPITHELIAL_MESENCHYMAL_TRANSITION \n    179 \n    172 \n    172 \n    204 \n    0.85 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_EARLY \n    189 \n    176 \n    162 \n    216 \n    0.81 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_LATE \n    176 \n    162 \n    162 \n    218 \n    0.76 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_FATTY_ACID_METABOLISM \n    128 \n    124 \n    127 \n    165 \n    0.77 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_G2M_CHECKPOINT \n    187 \n    172 \n    173 \n    204 \n    0.87 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_GLYCOLYSIS \n    173 \n    167 \n    167 \n    215 \n    0.79 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_HEDGEHOG_SIGNALING \n    24 \n    21 \n    25 \n    36 \n    0.65 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_HEME_METABOLISM \n    152 \n    150 \n    138 \n    214 \n    0.69 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_HYPOXIA \n    168 \n    163 \n    163 \n    215 \n    0.77 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_IL2_STAT5_SIGNALING \n    163 \n    156 \n    163 \n    216 \n    0.74 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_IL6_JAK_STAT3_SIGNALING \n    65 \n    62 \n    63 \n    103 \n    0.61 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_INFLAMMATORY_RESPONSE \n    142 \n    131 \n    144 \n    222 \n    0.63 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_INTERFERON_ALPHA_RESPONSE \n    92 \n    90 \n    81 \n    140 \n    0.63 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_INTERFERON_GAMMA_RESPONSE \n    178 \n    176 \n    164 \n    286 \n    0.6 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_KRAS_SIGNALING_DN \n    71 \n    54 \n    82 \n    220 \n    0.31 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_KRAS_SIGNALING_UP \n    156 \n    147 \n    146 \n    220 \n    0.68 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_MITOTIC_SPINDLE \n    194 \n    189 \n    168 \n    215 \n    0.85 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_MTORC1_SIGNALING \n    190 \n    189 \n    176 \n    211 \n    0.88 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_MYC_TARGETS_V1 \n    194 \n    194 \n    185 \n    236 \n    0.81 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_MYC_TARGETS_V2 \n    58 \n    57 \n    52 \n    60 \n    0.93 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_MYOGENESIS \n    126 \n    131 \n    139 \n    212 \n    0.62 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_NOTCH_SIGNALING \n    29 \n    28 \n    29 \n    34 \n    0.84 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_OXIDATIVE_PHOSPHORYLATION \n    199 \n    185 \n    169 \n    220 \n    0.84 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_P53_PATHWAY \n    177 \n    172 \n    160 \n    215 \n    0.79 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_PANCREAS_BETA_CELLS \n    14 \n    13 \n    17 \n    44 \n    0.33 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_PEROXISOME \n    85 \n    84 \n    87 \n    110 \n    0.78 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_PI3K_AKT_MTOR_SIGNALING \n    91 \n    91 \n    84 \n    118 \n    0.75 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_PROTEIN_SECRETION \n    94 \n    92 \n    90 \n    98 \n    0.94 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_REACTIVE_OXYGEN_SPECIES_PATHWAY \n    46 \n    47 \n    43 \n    58 \n    0.78 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_SPERMATOGENESIS \n    62 \n    59 \n    71 \n    144 \n    0.44 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_TGF_BETA_SIGNALING \n    49 \n    50 \n    45 \n    59 \n    0.81 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_TNFA_SIGNALING_VIA_NFKB \n    175 \n    173 \n    166 \n    228 \n    0.75 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_UNFOLDED_PROTEIN_RESPONSE \n    106 \n    106 \n    98 \n    115 \n    0.9 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_UV_RESPONSE_DN \n    129 \n    131 \n    121 \n    152 \n    0.84 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_UV_RESPONSE_UP \n    129 \n    126 \n    127 \n    191 \n    0.67 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_WNT_BETA_CATENIN_SIGNALING \n    36 \n    33 \n    36 \n    50 \n    0.7 \n  \n  \n    HALLMARK_XENOBIOTIC_METABOLISM \n    142 \n    135 \n    141 \n    224 \n    0.62 \n  \n  \n    SET_ERPR \n    18 \n    16 \n    16 \n    18 \n    0.93 \n  \n  \n    random_200 \n    149 \n    132 \n    157 \n    200 \n    0.73 \n  \n  \n    random_18 \n    15 \n    14 \n    11 \n    18 \n    0.74 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the genes are available in all datasets. When calculating scores it is always good to check the availability of the genes. Otherwise this can make the score unstable, since too many of the genes are missing. For example, HALLMARK_PANCREAS_BETA_CELLS might have an unstable score, due to a lot of genes missing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each dataset one can plot the differences in scores for ER+ and ER- BC patients. This should be already an indication that the scores are meaningful. The next sections shows the results for each dataset individually.\n\n\n\n\nTCGAMETABRICSCANB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Scores for TCGA patients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Scores for METABRIC patients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Scores for SCANB patients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plots above one can conclude that three different estrogen pathways capture the differences between ER status and also molecular subtypes. There are two plots with random genes for control and we can see that there is no difference between the ER status when using those gene sets.\nBelow is a combined image for TCGA, SCANB and METABRIC using the \\(SET_{ER/PR}\\) signature.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: SET ER/PR scores for all three cohorts.\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to look at the data is to plot by molecular subtype instead of ER status.\n\nTCGAMETABRICSCANB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Scores for TCGA patients stratified by PAM50 molecular subtype\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Scores for METABRIC patients stratified by PAM50 molecular subtype\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: Scores for SCANB patients stratified by PAM50 molecular subtype\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn all cohorts the luminal A and B patients have a similar score. Also the distinction is very clear between the basal and HER2-like patients versus luminal A and B.\nOne question that usually arises when calculating scores from gene sets is if proliferation associated genes (PAG) are driving the distinctions. These signatures are highly curated and they have close or no PAGs. Therefore, the scores are not affected by PAGs and they really reflect the biology.\nLastly we show in Figure 1.9 the correlation of the estrogen signaling scores with the signatures.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.9: Scores for SCANB patients stratified by PAM50 molecular subtype\n\n\n\n\nWe see that there is a positive correlation between signatures and scores, the problem though is the high variability in the scores in this case.\nIn the next section we will show how these scores are also prognostic for ER+ BC patients."

    "section": "1.4 Survival analysis",
    "text": "1.4 Survival analysis\nSince the scores are continuous variables and they are already scaled due to the output of GSVA, cox regression (Cox 1972) can be used. The advantages of using cox regression is that one can control for other variables. You might ask, why should one control for clinical variables? One of the reasons is because the data being dealt here is observational data. There are several confounders, for example, a score might be up because patients with a higher tumor grade have higher expression of some genes. Thus the score is confounded by the tumor grade and the interpretation changes.\nThere are limitations still when dealing with observational data. A strong hypothesis for performing survival analysis with observational data is that we have measured all the confounder variables. This is pretty strong and in practice we never know if a confounder is missing or not. For a more thorough overview of the causal framework for observational data, check the books (Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari 2020; McElreath 2020).\nAll the cohorts have a different set of clinical variables available. Therefore, the regression will be done by adjusting a different set of variables. Below is the description of the variables used for each cohort.11 This webpage explains with more details the different tumor stages and how BC are classified.\n\nAge: age is one of the most important factors to adjust, specially in breast cancer. This covariate is used for all cohorts.\nNPI: the Nottingham prognostic index scores each tumor based on tumor grade, tumor size and number of lymph nodes. Only METABRIC has this information.\nTumor Size: as name describes. Only SCANB has this information.\nTumor Stage: tumors are usually described in terms of stage, it reflects the tumor size and location. SCANB and TCGA have this information.\nNode Stage: similar to tumor stage, but encodes the number of lymph nodes where breast cancer cells can be found. SCANB and TCGA have this information.\n\nThus the models we are going to use for the survival analysis of each dataset is shown below.\n\nTCGA: ~ score + age + node_stage + tumor_stage,\nSCANB: ~ score + age + node_stage + tumor_stage,\nMETABRIC: ~ score + age + NPI,\n\nwhere score is one of the scores calculated earlier with GSVA. Note here that since each node stage and tumor stage have sub classifications they will be grouped together, otherwise there will be too many variables with few points. We will also subselect specific tumor stages for TCGA and SCANB, since there are very few patients with tumor stage 4.\nTo be very specific in the survival analysis, only endocrine treated patients should be used in the analysis, as that is what are interested in. METABRIC and SCANB has this kind of annotation, but TCGA not. So the survival analysis on SCANB and METABRIC will be performed on endocrine only treated, ER+ BC patients. On TCGA, to mitigate this effect, we subselect only luminal A and B patients, and we keep in mind that they might have been treated with chemotherapy as well. Moreover, in Sweden the guidelines for BC treatment is to use 10% as the threshold for ER status. Therefore, ER+ BC patients used on SCANB are those that are above the 10% threshold.\nThe table below shows the number of patients for each cohort.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    cohort \n    number_patients \n    nb_events \n  \n \n\n  \n    TCGA \n    684 \n    73 \n  \n  \n    SCANB \n    1021 \n    253 \n  \n  \n    METABRIC \n    938 \n    576 \n  \n  \n    SCANB High ER \n    800 \n    173 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.1 Results\nThe table below shows the results for each analysis performed for a specific term. In order to understand the table the user can filter based on the term, cohort and type of analysis. Since METABRIC has recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS), the results for both analysis are presented here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table above shows that \\(SET_{ER/PR}\\) had a small hazard ratio (< 1) in all 4 analysis performed. Moreover, for all cases where a measure of estrogen signaling was used, the hazard ratio was below 1, indicating that the higher the score, the less likely the patient is to suffer the event in a specific timepoint. This indicates that ER signaling is actually something continuous and not dichotomous.\nFigure 1.10 shows the forest plot of HALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_EARLY for all three cohorts.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.10: Forest plots of the different cohorts and their hazard ratios. The bars correspond to 95% confidence interval.\n\n\n\n\nThe hazard ratios are all below 1 and small for HALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_EARLY. The variability changes depending on the cohort, specially because they have different follow-up times, SCANB being the shortest. TCGA has very few number of events and we could not select based on the treatment, the results for TCGA are less reliable."

    "text": "1.5 Comparison of ER IHC and molecular ER signaling\nThe new released dataset from the SCANB consortium contains the ER percentage based on the IHC stainings. This is great, because we can now compare the molecular ER signaling score to what is seen in the clinics.\nFirst we start by comparing the molecular score with the percentages (Figure 1.11).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.11: Correlation between ER IHC percentage and molecular ER signaling by using the signature HALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_EARLY and SET ER/PR.\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing that one can notice is that ER percentage is very discrete, pathologists probably don’t assign non rounded percentage values, which makes sense. Another thing to notice is that for high ER percentage patients you have a whole spectrum of molecular ER signaling score.\nFigure 1.12 shows the distribution of the ER IHC percentage for the patients used in the previous survival analysis for SCANB.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.12: Histogram of ER IHC percentage of the SCANB samples used for survival analysis\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the majority of the patients actually have already pretty high percentage. It could be that the results of the overall survival analysis are actually driven by the the low ER percentage patients, so we performed the survival analysis only on patients with ER percentage equal or higher than 90%. The table below shows the total number of patients for each analysis.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    cohort \n    number_patients \n    nb_events \n  \n \n\n  \n    TCGA \n    684 \n    73 \n  \n  \n    SCANB \n    1021 \n    253 \n  \n  \n    METABRIC \n    938 \n    576 \n  \n  \n    SCANB High ER \n    800 \n    173 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a decrease of around 200 patients with 80 events less, so indeed a lot of those patients with lower ER percentage had died. Figure 1.13 shows the results of the survival analysis when considering the ER IHC percentage as a continuous score on SCANB.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.13: Survival analysis using ER IHC percentage as the score instead of the common molecular ER signaling scores\n\n\n\n\nWe a very tight confidence interval in this case with a HR very close to 1, meaning that for every 1% increase there is a 2% decrease in your risk of dying. The table with the values is shown below.\n\n\n  type_analysis cohort  score   term    estimate   std.error statistic\n1            os  scanb ER.pct ER.pct -0.02230453 0.004592472 -4.856758\n2           rfs  scanb ER.pct ER.pct -0.01651294 0.009355273 -1.765094\n       p.value        HR\n1 1.193230e-06 0.9779424\n2 7.754794e-02 0.9836227\n\n\nNext we selected only patients that had 90% or more ER IHC percentage to perform the survival analysis. Figure 1.14 shows the results for both the analysis done on ER IHC percentage,\nHALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_EARLY and SET_ERPR.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.14: Survival analysis using ER IHC percentage, HALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_EARLY and SET_ERPR as the scores. Only patients with 90% or more in the ER IHC were selected.\n\n\n\n\nWhen performing the survival analysis among the high ER percentage, there is no evidence to differentiate between 90 to 100%, but by using the molecular scores that fact is still true, showing that perhaps the molecular score could be more sensitive for these patients.\nWe can also analyse the recurrence free survival for this cohort (Figure 1.15).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.15: Survival analysis using ER IHC percentage, HALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_EARLY and SET_ERPR as the scores. Only patients with 90% or more in the ER IHC were selected.\n\n\n\n\nThe problem now is that the number of events is much smaller, so the confidence intervals for the estimates will be bigger. We see that for both signatures the HR is way below 1, meaning that the higher the score the better it is for the patient."

    "text": "1.6 Conclusion\nIn this chapter we’ve shown that ER+ BC patients are very distinct from each other, as it can be seen from the umap projections and the subtypes. These patients might respond differently for endocrine therapy as well, and this might depend on the ER signaling, how active it is. Therefore, when deciding a treatment, more care should be taken with ER+ BC patients and check their signaling scores somehow. The \\(SET_{ER/PR}\\) signature is a good signature showing very good hazard ratios across the different cohorts. This signature has also been validated on the clinics for use.\nKnowing the ER signaling for a patient is very important when deciding treatment, but not enough. What could be other alternatives for patients that have low ER signaling and are still considered ER+? Should they use only endocrine therapy or supplement it with something else? In the next chapters we present a framework where we can take a look at a more personalised approach for treatments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCox, D.

    "text": "In the next few chapters we will show a new framework for personalized medicine. This is motivated by the fact that we know already some patients are more sensitive to endocrine therapy than others, but we don’t know what are possible treatments. Moreover, it is very difficult to compare, molecularly, patients among themselves.\nThe PREDICT tool (Wishart et al. 2010) provides a tool for practitioners to calculate survival risks among patients with similar clinical characteristics. This is very important as it shows how to combine data from previous patients to guide further treatments of new patients. However, no additional information is given, such as alternative pathways to target or what might be different from other patients.\nOther tools that help in the clinics are the molecular signatures developed by companies (Wallden et al. 2015; Vijver et al. 2002; Paik et al. 2004). These signatures are intended to be used with ER+ BC patients and depending on the tool, on node negative, post-menopausal women. Based on the set of genes, a risk score is assigned or each patient. The score means if a patient would benefit from additional chemotherapy besides the usual endocrine therapy received for either 5 or 10 years. They also lack the additional information of what are possible pathways involved and alternative treatments beside chemotherapy.\nThere are a few challenges to overcome pathway analysis for patients individually and how to compare patients molecularly. There is no tool that allows to integrate patients in a continuous way. Usually integration is a one step procedure and cannot be updated. The usual tools are (Risso et al. 2014; Zhang, Parmigiani, and Johnson 2020; Fei et al. 2018) and they do not provide batch effect removal for new samples. The only way is to re-run the procedure together with the new sample. The problem of doing this is usually you don’t have enough samples to estimate batch effects across groups and therefore correct it.\nThis chapter show how to perform PCA projection using samples from different datasets and how new samples can be introduced without retraining of the PCA. We first introduce the notion of a new normalization that depends on housekeeping genes. After using this new normalization, we proceed with PCA on a subset of two cohorts using the 1000 most variable genes. We then validate the integration with new samples from a completely different cohort."

    "text": "2.1 Transcriptomics and qPCR normalization\nIn this first step we introduce a new normalization. The rational is that we need a normalization procedure that is applied in a single sample only, similar to logCPM, but that can be applied to microarray too. In this case, given a set of samples, we start by ranking the genes in each sample. We then normalize the ranking to be between 0 and 1, i.e., we divide by the total number of genes available in that sample. Then, given a list of 50 stable genes across cancer (Bhuva, Cursons, and Davis 2020), we calculate the average ranking of these genes in the sample and then for each gene in the sample we divide by this average.\n\n2.1.1 Selecting stable genes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step is to check what number of these 50 genes are available on TCGA and METABRIC, as these datasets will be used for training the PCA projection. The total number of available genes is 44. Table 2.1 shows the name of the genes available in TCGA and METABRIC.\nNow we select the 1000 most variable genes across METABRIC and TCGA. Reducing the number of genes used when calculating the PCA helps in the future. Several publicly available datasets don’t have many genes available, therefore reducing the number of genes increases the chances of using this approach in other datasets.\nMoreover, the use of a large number of genes is used because if some of them are not available. We show in later sections that if some number of stable genes are missing, it will not affect the normalization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: (Table 2.1) Available stable genes in both TCGA and METABRIC cohorts.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Calculating the normalization\nWe will create subset of the summarised experiment objects to save these information. Moreover, since a summarized experiment object is being used, we can save the new normalization in the assays and the average ranking scores of the housekeeping genes in the column data colData. This way it is very easy to retrieve the information for the patients.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Comparison of coefficient of variation and standard deviation scores.\n\n\n\n\nThey are highly correlated values, so we stick to the coefficient of variation as it makes more sense in this kind of analysis.\n\n\n\nTable 2.3 shows the top 1000 genes along with their standard deviation. The stable genes are also added to the list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: (Table 2.3) Standard deviation of each gene in each condition and pooled standard deviation.\n\n\n\nOverall we can see that housekeeping genes have very low standard deviation across cohorts, which is good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4 shows a histogram with the distribution of the average ranking of the housekeeping genes for each sample in each cohort.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Distribution of the average ranking of the housekeeping genes defined previously for each cohort separately.\n\n\n\n\nThe average ranking are somewhat similar. For the two experiments where there are RNA-seq samples, the distribution is the same. For METABRIC, a microarray experiment, the distribution is shifted a bit below.\nFigure 2.5 shows histograms of gene expression from some important genes in breast cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Distribution of the gene expression levels of ESR1 and TFF1 in each one of the cohorts\n\n\n\n\nESR1 and TFF1 expressions are divided across ER status, as expected. The proliferation marker CCND1 is also highly expressed in all conditions.\n\n\n2.1.3 Checking robustness with respect of number of houesekeeping genes available\nWhen calculating the normalized data, a total of 44 housekeeping genes were used. Sometimes not all of these genes are available, therefore we will calculate the normalization using random subsets of 44 housekeeping genes with different random sizes. The sets will have a minimum of 20 genes and maximum of 44. The sampling of the set size is obtained by using a uniform distribution. We focus just on TCGA for simplicity. The correlation used in this case was the Pearson correlation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Correlation distribution for different subsets of housekeeping genes (HKGs). Each different subset has a different number of HKGs.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6 shows the different distributions given the subsets of housekeeping genes. All the correlation coefficients are close to 1. This means that if a subset of housekeeping genes are missing it is fine, as the others will compensate."

    "text": "2.2 Integrating TCGA and METABRIC using PCA\nThe next step is creating the framework where we can integrate any patient sample and compare each other, at least spatially. The approach is similar to some sort of unsupervised learning, where no labels or groups are specified, which is something common in algorithms for batch removal. By using PCA in some subset of TCGA and METABRIC, we should learn the idiosyncrasies of the RNA-seq and microarray technologies as well as batch effects general to datasets. Since these two cohorts are big ones, we assume that if there are common batch effects, they are represented on them.\nThe practical steps are: first subselect 1000 samples in total from METABRIC and TCGA. Train PCA using these 1000 samples. Validate the results by projecting the other samples. In the next section we show how robust the approach is when selecting the samples. In the next chapters we validate the projection in unseen cohorts.\nIntegrating as laid out here only uses molecular data, therefore patients might be close to each other but they might have very different clinical features. This should always be kept in mind.\n\n\n\nThe table below shows the molecular characteristics of the patients selected for the PCA training.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    cohort \n    basal \n    claudin-low \n    her2 \n    luma \n    lumb \n    nc \n    normal \n  \n \n\n  \n    metabric \n    83 \n    78 \n    71 \n    215 \n    158 \n    2 \n    41 \n  \n  \n    tcga \n    69 \n    0 \n    29 \n    177 \n    61 \n    0 \n    16 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7 shows the embedding of the two datasets together of the 1000 samples used for training.

The third component explains the ER status and the two cohorts are well inter mingled. When plotting the third and fourth components and coloring by the molecular subtype, we see a clear distinction, recapitulating the biology.\nThe plot below shows how the loadings of the first component are really concentrated around zero, so there are not actually specific genes that are accounting for the batch effects we see in the first component. We show latter that the genes that are the most important are the ones with high loading, so the tail of the distributions. In this sense there are really no genes in the tail of the loadings for PC1.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Different loadings for the first 4 components.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9 shows all the samples from TCGA and cohort projected into the molecular landscape. The samples are mixing well, the only thing is that METABRIC is a bit offset to the left bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Original PC3 and PC4 of all samples, including test and train samples, of TCGA and METABRIC.\n\n\n\n\nAnd Figure 2.10.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: Original PC3 and PC4 of all samples, including test and train samples, of TCGA and METABRIC.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to check if the integration made sense, it is possible to color by ER status, NPI for METABRIC samples and tumor/node stage for TCGA. To check ER signaling scores, the pathways Estrogen response early/late and \\(SET_{ER/PR}\\) are used to color the projection.\nFigure 2.11 shows the coloring by age.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: PC3 and PC4 of samples from TCGA and METABRIC colored by age.\n\n\n\n\nAge seems to be well mixed. Figure 2.12 shows the PCA colored by ER status.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: PC3 and PC4 of samples from TCGA and METABRIC colored by ER status.\n\n\n\n\nIt has a very good separation among the different patients. Figure 2.13 is the PCA embedding colored by NPI. Only METABRIC samples have this information.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.13: PC3 and PC4 of samples from METABRIC only colored by NPI.\n\n\n\n\nIt looks good, ER+ BC patients have lower NPI, which makes sense. Figure 2.14 shows the biplot colored by tumor purity.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.14: PC3 and PC4 of samples from METABRIC only colored by tumor purity.\n\n\n\n\nThe tumor purity is not a factor that is affecting the embedding as samples with low cellularity (< 40% of tumor cells) and high cellularity (> 70% of tumor cells) intermingle.\nMETABRIC has also inferred menopausal status for the patients, we use this information to check if there is any enrichment based on the patient menopausal status (Figure 2.15)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.15: PC3 and PC4 of samples from METABRIC only colored by menopausal status.\n\n\n\n\nWe don’t see any difference between the two status. We proceed now with the analysis using clinical factors from TCGA.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.16: PC3 and PC4 of samples from TCGA only colored by tumor stage and node stage.\n\n\n\n\nFor both tumor and node stage the samples seem to have mixed well, indicating the projection is not a function of the stages, as shown in Figure 2.16.\nAnd finally Figure 2.17 below shows the color by PAM50 molecular subtype.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.17: Corrected PC3 and PC4 of samples from TCGA and METABRIC colored by PAM50 molecular subtype.\n\n\n\n\nThe molecular subtypes are projected as expected, going from left to right there are the basal-like BC patients, going to HER2 and then they are split between luminal A and B. The normal like patients are in the top and closer to the luminal A, reflecting the biology.\nThe next figures show the ER signaling measures coloring the projections.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.18: biplot of PC3 and PC4 of samples from TCGA and METABRIC colored by the SET ER/PR score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.19: biplot of PC3 and PC4 of samples from TCGA and METABRIC colored by the hallmark estrogen response early.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.20: biplot of PC3 and PC4 of samples from TCGA and METABRIC colored by the hallmark estrogen response late\n\n\n\n\nIn all cases the mixing is relatively good. For \\(SET_{ER/PR}\\) you have a gradient going from the right to the left, showing again that patients on the far top right probably are those patients with better prognosis."

    "section": "3.2 Missing genes",
    "text": "3.2 Missing genes\nGenes missing in publicly available datasets is very common. Usually this is due to processing pipelines or even data quality, therefore genes are removed. This should not be much of a problem, if the data is good enough, when calculating the qPCR-like normalization as it was shown before. The problem arises when multiplying the loadings obtained in the PCA with the normalized expression of the sample. If several genes are missing, 0s are added to the matrix and therefore the loadings for these genes cannot be used. Since 1000 genes were used, we investigate the loadings of genes and try to calculate a fuzziness score, indicating when the embedding should be trusted if genes are missing, and which genes are missing.\n\n3.2.1 Fuzziness score\nThe idea of the fuzziness score is that we use the loadings of the missing genes and calculate the cumulative sum of their absolute values. The higher this value the more it indicates the missing genes are important. We start by removing random genes from random samples of the SCANB cohort. Each sample will have a random number of genes removed from the set of 1044 genes. Then two scores are calculated, one for PC2 and another for PC3. We also calculate the fuzziness score for the top loading genes and the low loadings genes, to compare these values.\nWe start by comparing the scores from top loadings and low loading genes. For this we remove the top 50 loadings and bottom 50 loadings, in terms of absolute values. Figure 3.4 shows the cumulative sum of the absolute values from the top and bottom loadings respectively. See how important the top loadings are compared to the bottom loadings. A way of thinking of this is that the top loadings weights are much more important when calculating the embedding.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Cumulative sum of absolute values for the top loadings and bottom loadings as a function of the number of selected genes.\n\n\n\n\nThis was using the top loadings, so probably the fuzziness score of a sample with relatively good data will be between 0 and 12 maximum, meaning that they have less than 200 genes missing. When genes are missing, we hope that they are in the bottom part of the loadings, so the fuzziness score is as small as possible.\nSuppose now that the genes missing in a sample are random. We will calculate random fuzziness scores based on this to have a feeling of the scores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Distribution of the fuzziness scores from random missing genes. Each color corresponds to a different distribution using a different number of genes.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5 shows the results as a function of the number of missing genes. We see that in average, if 200 genes are missing, the fuzziness score is around 5. If less than a 100 genes are missing, the fuzziness score is around 3. In the next section we show how this influences the position where the sample is projected into the embedding.\nFinally, we calculate the fuzziness score as a number of top loadings missing. Suppose 150 genes are missing. We will change the proportion of genes that are in the top loadings and in the missing list. Since the cumulative sum for PC2 and PC3 are very similar, we focus only on PC2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Distribution of the fuzziness scores from 150 random missing genes with different proportions of top loading genes in the list. Each color corresponds to a different distribution using a different proportion of genes.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6 shows the fuzziness score with different proportions of the top loading genes. We see that they are actually very important when calculating the score. The top loading genes were defined as the top 150 genes in the list. So when calculating the number of missing genes it is important to check the number of top loadings in the list.\n\n\n3.2.2 Validating the score\nIn this section we calculate the embeddings with different number of genes missing from a given sample and then plot the original embedding with the newly one. For this we use samples from TCGA. The genes are removed even before the normalization procedure, as they are usually not available there. We select randomly a number of top genes from PC3 and PC4 to compose the list of missing genes. The proportion of the top loading genes is varied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTCGA-OL-A66K-01A-11R-A29R-07TCGA-GI-A2C9-01A-11R-A21T-07TCGA-3C-AALK-01A-11R-A41B-07TCGA-BH-A0BW-01A-11R-A115-07TCGA-A1-A0SI-01A-11R-A144-07TCGA-D8-A27L-01A-11R-A16F-07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.9: ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.10: ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.11: ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.12: ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen looking at the figures above, it seems that whenever there are genes missing, and the more of top loadings they are, the closer they are to the origin. This makes sense, since PCA is doing a simple linear combination of the loadings. This should be fine to correct, since we can fit a line going through the origin and goes through the points above. Then the adjustment will depend on the number of genes that are missing and are top loadings. The more they are, the more adjustment we will need.\nFor the adjustment we only know two things, its current position and how many of the top loadings are missing. Based on this information we should be able to correct the samples. Given the list of genes that are missing, we fit lines that would go through the genes that are missing in the TCGA and METABRIC samples. We then try to find the line that is closes to the point. After performing the fit and the line, we can then move the point to closer to the METABRIC and TCGA samples. The point should be close to the line and close to points that have the same proportion of top loadings missing.\n\n\n\nThese plots show how the fuzziness score might be indicative of how good the embedding will be depending on the number of missing genes. The video below shows the images for 20 different patients. Notice how all of them are connected to the origin as well."

    "text": "This chapter we present a new way to think about the personalized medicine, by incorporating patient molecular information and its context. We saw previously that by using different cohorts, we can embed new patients into a point cloud. The idea is that the neighborhood of the patients are similar in the molecular level, and we can draw conclusions based on this.\nEach patient can be assigned a score. Scores represent a biological pathway, or in other words, a biological activity. Given a biological process, there is usually a set of genes that represent it. We can then use these set of genes to calculate scores that are proxies of this biological activity.\nFor example, in the previous chapters we used the ER signaling scores to motivate the continuity of ER signaling. This is not restricted to this specific pathway, we could have used any other list of genes representing a process.\nBy combining a score and the neighborhood of a patient, we can make direct comparisons and questions. Given a patient, how different is its score for a pathway compared to its neighbors? Is there also an alternative pathway that could be target and has a higher signaling? In this case specifically, is ER signaling more or less expressed compared to its neighbors?\nThe POETIC trial (Gao et al. 2019) is a breast cancer trial that had as hypothesis neoadjuvant therapy could improve overall and recurrence free survival. They gave aromatase inhibitors (AIs) for ER+ BC patients for 2 weeks prior to surgery and then 2 weeks after surgery. Moreover, they collected a needle biopsy before the treatment started and a biopsy in the surgery. They also measured the Ki67 levels, therefore we have a proxy on how well these patients responded in the short term to AIs. Also, they sent the tissues for sequencing, so microarray data is available. This is a unique cohort, in the sense that we can understand what are the responders or not, in terms of Ki67 levels, and use the molecular data to try to understand the responsiveness. The definition of responders are those patients that have a reduction of at least 60% in Ki67 levels when comparing pre-treatment versus surgery.\nHere we use this cohort to draw conclusions on responders and non responders and how the molecular landscape can be used. We show that some patients that are close to each other in the molecular landscape can have different pathway scores and therefore have different responses."

We set the prior distribution for the intercept to be a normal distribution centered at 0 with standard deviation of 1. All scores are in a range of -1 to 1, so this is a relatively flat prior for our use case.\nThe video below shows how scores change in average when comparing different neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing from right to left it shows how ER signaling is decreased.

    "section": "4.4 Analysing patient neighborhoods",
    "text": "4.4 Analysing patient neighborhoods\nThere are two ways to interpret the embedding. If the patient has ER+ BC and its embedding is close to the ER- BC patients, we can infer that the endocrine response might not work so well, as it was shown in Figure 4.2. The other option is to compare the patient’s score to the average score of its neighborhood.\nWhat is a neighborhood? When performing the embedding, global structures are not preserved usually. In this sense we only compare patients that are close to each other in an euclidean neighborhood, i.e., we calculate a radius around each sample and see what other samples are within this ball given the euclidean distance.\nGiven a neighborhood, one can calculate the posterior average score of all samples from METABRIC, SCANB and TCGA and use that as an indication of average score that we can compare other patients to. The concept is that if an ER+ BC patient has a much lower ER signaling score, it means the patients will not respond so well to endocrine therapy, as they are very different from their neighboors.\nTo showcase the ability to use the scores and infer results, we use the POETIC trial patients to compare the scores. This cohort is special in the sense that the patients are filtered based on selection criterias, meaning that the patients are clinically similar.\nTwo random patients in very close neighborhoods were selected to showcase the ability of the molecular landscape. The id of the patients are 63 and 236. Table 4.3 shows the clinical features of these patients. One of them is HER2+. Patient 63 had a higher Ki67 baseline level but a very good response to endocrine therapy. Patient 236 did not respond to endocrine therapy in terms of reduction of Ki67 levels.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.3:  Clinical features from patients 63 and 236. \n \n  \n    patient_nb \n    er_status \n    her2_status \n    ki67 \n    change_ki67 \n    ccca_surgery_ki67_2_7 \n  \n \n\n  \n    63 \n    pos \n    Positive \n    16.60702 \n    -69.958509 \n    noCCCA \n  \n  \n    236 \n    pos \n    Negative \n    11.30906 \n    5.593711 \n    noCCCA \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5 shows the embedding of two distinct patients in a similar neighborhood.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Plot of two selected patients in the molecular landscape. One is a responder and the other is a non responder. The patient id numbers are 63 and 236.\n\n\n\n\nAnd now we calculate the average scores for each patient neighborhoods. We start by defining a radius value. After that we select the patients in the neighborhood and use rstanarm to get the posterior distribution of the average score in the neighborhood. For this we use the function stan_glm to calculate the average. This is effective because it can be paired with the package tidybayes for plotting. It makes extremely easy to deal with posterior data. For the average we use a normal prior centered at 0 with 1 standard deviation, since all scores are between -1 and 1.\n\n\n\nPatient 63 Figure 4.6 is considered a responder. According to the scores, when comparing the estrogen early signature to its average distribution in the neighborhood, the score is higher.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Posterior distribution of the average scores in the neighborhood of patient 236 from POETIC trial.
