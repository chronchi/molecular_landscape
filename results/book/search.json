    "section": "",
    "text": "Currently in the clinics estrogen receptor (ER) status is treated as dichotomous condition. Either a breast cancer (BC) is ER positive (ER+) or ER negative (ER-). The threshold for ER+ cells usually is 1% or 10% of the cells positive in a IHC staining. The idea is that ER+ BC patients will receive endocrine therapy, usually tamoxifen or some aromatase inhibitor, for treatment. The problem is not all patients respond the same to these drugs and they also have different proportions of ER+ cells.\nIn this document we show how leveraging molecular information distinguishes ER+ BC patients and how one should look more carefully on ER status. In order to do this, estrogen related signatures: estrogen response early and late from MSigDB(Subramanian et al. 2005) and \\(SET_{ER/PR}\\)(Sinn et al. 2019), are used to calculate scores for each BC patient. These scores then are used to calculate associations with survival analysis. When performing cox regression, we try to adjust for sensible covariates in order to reduce bias. Even though we are adjusting, it is very difficult to know if a covariate is missing in the regression. Thus, care should be always taken when interpreting these results.\nThis chapter is structure in the following way. First section corresponds to loading the datasets and then filtering them. Estrogen signatures scores are calculated using GSVA (Hänzelmann, Castelo, and Guinney 2013). Given the scores, cox regression can be performed adjusting for clinical variables. After this the Hazard ratios can be computed and interpreted along with their confidence intervals."

Here we use GSVA to calculate the scores, even when using their genes.\n\n\n\nBefore we calculate any score, let us check the number of genes available for each pathway in each dataset. This is important, in other to have robust scores, most of the genes should be available in the datasets.

When calculating scores it is always good to check the availability of the genes. Otherwise this can make the score unstable, since too many of the genes are missing. For example, HALLMARK_PANCREAS_BETA_CELLS might have an unstable score, due to a lot of genes missing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each dataset one can plot the differences in scores for ER+ and ER- BC patients. This should be already an indication that the scores are meaningful. The next sections shows the results for each dataset individually.\n\n\n\n\nTCGAMETABRICSCANB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Scores for TCGA patients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Scores for METABRIC patients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Scores for SCANB patients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plots above one can conclude that three different estrogen pathways capture the differences between ER status and also molecular subtypes. There are two plots with random genes for control and we can see that there is no difference between the ER status when using those gene sets.\nBelow is a combined image for TCGA, SCANB and METABRIC using the \\(SET_{ER/PR}\\) signature.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: SET ER/PR scores for all three cohorts.\n\n\n\n\nAnd now using the hallmark estrogen response early.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Estrogen early scores for all three cohorts.\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to look at the data is to plot by molecular subtype instead of ER status.\n\nTCGAMETABRICSCANB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Scores for TCGA patients stratified by PAM50 molecular subtype\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: Scores for METABRIC patients stratified by PAM50 molecular subtype\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.9: Scores for SCANB patients stratified by PAM50 molecular subtype\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn all cohorts the luminal A and B patients have a similar score. Also the distinction is very clear between the basal and HER2-like patients versus luminal A and B.\nOne question that usually arises when calculating scores from gene sets is if proliferation associated genes (PAG) are driving the distinctions. These signatures are highly curated and they have close or no PAGs. Therefore, the scores are not affected by PAGs and they really reflect the biology.\nLastly we show in Figure 1.10 the correlation of the estrogen signaling scores with the signatures.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.10: Scores for SCANB patients stratified by PAM50 molecular subtype\n\n\n\n\nWe see that there is a positive correlation between signatures and scores, the problem though is the high variability in the scores in this case.\nIn the next section we will show how these scores are also prognostic for ER+ BC patients."

    "section": "1.4 Survival analysis",
    "text": "1.4 Survival analysis\nSince the scores are continuous variables and they are already scaled due to the output of GSVA, cox regression (Cox 1972) can be used. The advantages of using cox regression is that one can control for other variables. You might ask, why should one control for clinical variables? One of the reasons is because the data being dealt here is observational data. There are several confounders, for example, a score might be up because patients with a higher tumor grade have higher expression of some genes. Thus the score is confounded by the tumor grade and the interpretation changes.\nThere are limitations still when dealing with observational data. A strong hypothesis for performing survival analysis with observational data is that we have measured all the confounder variables. This is pretty strong and in practice we never know if a confounder is missing or not. For a more thorough overview of the causal framework for observational data, check the books (Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari 2020; McElreath 2020).\nAll the cohorts have a different set of clinical variables available. Therefore, the regression will be done by adjusting a different set of variables. Below is the description of the variables used for each cohort.11 This webpage explains with more details the different tumor stages and how BC are classified.\n\nAge: age is one of the most important factors to adjust, specially in breast cancer. This covariate is used for all cohorts.\nNPI: the Nottingham prognostic index scores each tumor based on tumor grade, tumor size and number of lymph nodes. Only METABRIC has this information.\nTumor Size: as name describes. Only SCANB has this information.\nTumor Stage: tumors are usually described in terms of stage, it reflects the tumor size and location. SCANB and TCGA have this information.\nNode Stage: similar to tumor stage, but encodes the number of lymph nodes where breast cancer cells can be found. SCANB and TCGA have this information.\n\nThus the models we are going to use for the survival analysis of each dataset is shown below.\n\nTCGA: ~ score + age + node_stage + tumor_stage,\nSCANB: ~ score + age + node_stage + tumor_stage,\nMETABRIC: ~ score + age + NPI,\n\nwhere score is one of the scores calculated earlier with GSVA. Note here that since each node stage and tumor stage have sub classifications they will be grouped together, otherwise there will be too many variables with few points. We will also subselect specific tumor stages for TCGA and SCANB, since there are very few patients with tumor stage 4.\nTo be very specific in the survival analysis, only endocrine treated patients should be used in the analysis, as that is what are interested in. METABRIC and SCANB has this kind of annotation, but TCGA not. So the survival analysis on SCANB and METABRIC will be performed on endocrine only treated, ER+ BC patients. On TCGA, to mitigate this effect, we subselect only luminal A and B patients, and we keep in mind that they might have been treated with chemotherapy as well. Moreover, in Sweden the guidelines for BC treatment is to use 10% as the threshold for ER status. Therefore, ER+ BC patients used on SCANB are those that are above the 10% threshold.\nThe table below shows the number of patients for each cohort.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    cohort \n    number_patients \n    nb_events \n  \n \n\n  \n    TCGA \n    684 \n    73 \n  \n  \n    SCANB \n    3603 \n    637 \n  \n  \n    METABRIC \n    934 \n    573 \n  \n  \n    SCANB High ER \n    2860 \n    454 \n  \n  \n    SCANB Low ER \n    228 \n    43 \n  \n  \n    SCANB High ESR1 \n    486 \n    111 \n  \n  \n    METABRIC High ESR1 \n    254 \n    175 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.1 Results\nThe table below shows the results for each analysis performed for a specific term. In order to understand the table the user can filter based on the term, cohort and type of analysis. Since METABRIC has recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS), the results for both analysis are presented here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table above shows that \\(SET_{ER/PR}\\) had a small hazard ratio (< 1) in all 4 analysis performed. Moreover, for all cases where a measure of estrogen signaling was used, the hazard ratio was below 1, indicating that the higher the score, the less likely the patient is to suffer the event in a specific timepoint. This indicates that ER signaling is actually something continuous and not dichotomous.\nFigure 1.11 shows the forest plot of HALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_EARLY for all three cohorts.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.11: Forest plots of the different cohorts and their hazard ratios. The bars correspond to 95% confidence interval.\n\n\n\n\nThe hazard ratios are all below 1 and small for HALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_EARLY. The variability changes depending on the cohort, specially because they have different follow-up times, SCANB being the shortest. TCGA has very few number of events and we could not select based on the treatment, the results for TCGA are less reliable."

    "text": "1.5 Comparison of ER IHC and molecular ER signaling\nThe new released dataset from the SCANB consortium contains the ER percentage based on the IHC stainings. This is great, because we can now compare the molecular ER signaling score to what is seen in the clinics.\nFirst we start by comparing the molecular score with the percentages (Figure 1.12).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.12: Correlation between ER IHC percentage and molecular ER signaling by using the signature HALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_EARLY and SET ER/PR.\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing that one can notice is that ER percentage is very discrete, pathologists probably don’t assign non rounded percentage values, which makes sense. Another thing to notice is that for high ER percentage patients you have a whole spectrum of molecular ER signaling score.\nNow we look speficially at the high ER percentage patients and compare their ER signaling scores. We previously saw that the distribution of these scores seems to be wide.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.13: Scores for high ER percentage breast cancer patients.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.13 shows how the distributions are not skewed towards high values only. It looks like there is a step in the SET ER/PR signature, we now compare with the ESR1 values and hallmark estrogen response early.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.14: Correlation between SET ER/PR and other scores.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a highly positive correlation. Also interesting to see that ESR1 levels are not necessarily highly correlated with high SET ER/PR scores. Remember that for ESR1 the scale is logarithmic, so even if the slope is smaller than in the hallmark estrogen response early, it might mean a higher correlation even..\nFigure 1.15 shows the distribution of the ER IHC percentage for the patients used in the previous survival analysis for SCANB.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.15: Histogram of ER IHC percentage of the SCANB samples used for survival analysis\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the majority of the patients actually have already pretty high percentage. It could be that the results of the overall survival analysis are actually driven by the the low ER percentage patients, so we performed the survival analysis only on patients with ER percentage equal or higher than 90%. The table below shows the total number of patients for each analysis.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    cohort \n    number_patients \n    nb_events \n  \n \n\n  \n    TCGA \n    684 \n    73 \n  \n  \n    SCANB \n    3603 \n    637 \n  \n  \n    METABRIC \n    934 \n    573 \n  \n  \n    SCANB High ER \n    2860 \n    454 \n  \n  \n    SCANB Low ER \n    228 \n    43 \n  \n  \n    SCANB High ESR1 \n    486 \n    111 \n  \n  \n    METABRIC High ESR1 \n    254 \n    175 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a decrease of around 200 patients with 80 events less, so indeed a lot of those patients with lower ER percentage had died. Figure 1.16 shows the results of the survival analysis when considering the ER IHC percentage as a continuous score on SCANB.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.16: Survival analysis using ER IHC percentage as the score instead of the common molecular ER signaling scores\n\n\n\n\nWe a very tight confidence interval in this case with a HR very close to 1, meaning that for every 1% increase there is a 2% decrease in your risk of dying. The table with the values is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we selected only patients that had 90% or more ER IHC percentage to perform the survival analysis. Figure 1.17 shows the results for both the analysis done on ER IHC percentage,\nHALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_EARLY and SET_ERPR.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.17: Survival analysis using ER IHC percentage, HALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_EARLY and SET_ERPR as the scores. Only patients with 90% or more in the ER IHC were selected.\n\n\n\n\nWhen performing the survival analysis among the high ER percentage, there is no evidence to differentiate between 90 to 100%, but by using the molecular scores that fact is still true, showing that perhaps the molecular score could be more sensitive for these patients.\nWe can also analyse the recurrence free survival for this cohort (Figure 1.18).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.18: Survival analysis using ER IHC percentage, HALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_EARLY and SET_ERPR as the scores. Only patients with 90% or more in the ER IHC were selected.\n\n\n\n\nThe problem now is that the number of events is much smaller, so the confidence intervals for the estimates will be bigger. We see that for both signatures the HR is way below 1, meaning that the higher the score the better it is for the patient. Also the hazard ratio decreased in this case.\nWe now evaluate the protective effect of the estrogen signaling signatures in the patients that have tumors with ER IHC lower than 90%.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.19: Survival analysis using ER IHC percentage, HALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_EARLY and SET_ERPR as the scores. Only patients with less than 90% in the ER IHC were selected.\n\n\n\n\nThe number of patients now is very low, but the effect is still there. When we look at the survival. Below we show the results for the overall survival.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.20: Survival analysis using ER IHC percentage, HALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_EARLY and SET_ERPR as the scores. Only patients with less than 90% in the ER IHC were selected.\n\n\n\n\nThe hazard ratio is still below 1 but the uncertainty is much higher, probably due to the number of patients and events.\nAnother way of evaluating the effect of estrogen signaling and not only the presence of the estrogen receptor protein or the mRNA transcripts, is to check the patients whose tumor samples have high expression of ESR1. We can perform such analysis in both METABRIC and SCANB.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.21: Survival analysis using ER IHC percentage, HALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_EARLY and SET_ERPR as the scores. Only patients with more than 7.5 units of ESR1 in the logFPKM scale were selected.\n\n\n\n\nThe number of events is very small but the HR is very small also and confidence interval is far away from 1. And now for METABRIC when we select all patients of 3rd quantile and above (median intensity higher than 11.5).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.22: Survival analysis using HALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_EARLY and SET_ERPR as the scores. Only patients with more than 11 units of ESR1 in the log median intensity scale were selected.\n\n\n\n\nThe variability is way higher but the hazard ratio is still below 1 as expected. In this case probably there are patients that have low score and don’t benefit as much from the treatment. Figure 1.23 shows the distribution of ER signaling scores for those patients. We notice that the average is very close to the peak of the distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.23: ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\nAnd below for all patients used for the full analysis on METABRIC.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.24: ?(caption)"

    "text": "1.6 Conclusion\nIn this chapter we’ve shown that ER+ BC patients are very distinct from each other, as it can be seen from the umap projections and the subtypes. These patients might respond differently for endocrine therapy as well, and this might depend on the ER signaling, how active it is. Therefore, when deciding a treatment, more care should be taken with ER+ BC patients and check their signaling scores somehow. The \\(SET_{ER/PR}\\) signature is a good signature showing very good hazard ratios across the different cohorts. This signature has also been validated on the clinics for use.\nKnowing the ER signaling for a patient is very important when deciding treatment, but not enough. What could be other alternatives for patients that have low ER signaling and are still considered ER+? Should they use only endocrine therapy or supplement it with something else? In the next chapters we present a framework where we can take a look at a more personalised approach for treatments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCox, D.

    "text": "In the next few chapters we will show a new framework for personalized medicine. This is motivated by the fact that we know already some patients are more sensitive to endocrine therapy than others, but we don’t know what are possible treatments. Moreover, it is very difficult to compare, molecularly, patients among themselves.\nThe PREDICT tool (Wishart et al. 2010) provides a tool for practitioners to calculate survival risks among patients with similar clinical characteristics. This is very important as it shows how to combine data from previous patients to guide further treatments of new patients. However, no additional information is given, such as alternative pathways to target or what might be different from other patients.\nOther tools that help in the clinics are the molecular signatures developed by companies (Wallden et al. 2015; Vijver et al. 2002; Paik et al. 2004). These signatures are intended to be used with ER+ BC patients and depending on the tool, on node negative, post-menopausal women. Based on the set of genes, a risk score is assigned or each patient. The score means if a patient would benefit from additional chemotherapy besides the usual endocrine therapy received for either 5 or 10 years. They also lack the additional information of what are possible pathways involved and alternative treatments beside chemotherapy.\nThere are a few challenges to overcome pathway analysis for patients individually and how to compare patients molecularly. There is no tool that allows to integrate patients in a continuous way. Usually integration is a one step procedure and cannot be updated. The usual tools are (Risso et al. 2014; Zhang, Parmigiani, and Johnson 2020; Fei et al. 2018) and they do not provide batch effect removal for new samples. The only way is to re-run the procedure together with the new sample. The problem of doing this is usually you don’t have enough samples to estimate batch effects across groups and therefore correct it.\nThis chapter show how to perform PCA projection using samples from different datasets and how new samples can be introduced without retraining of the PCA. We first introduce the notion of a new normalization that depends on housekeeping genes. After using this new normalization, we proceed with PCA on a subset of two cohorts using the 1000 most variable genes. We then validate the integration with new samples from a completely different cohort."

    "section": "2.1 Transcriptomics and qPCR normalization",
    "text": "2.1 Transcriptomics and qPCR normalization\nIn this first step we introduce a new normalization. The rational is that we need a normalization procedure that is applied in a single sample only, similar to logCPM, but that can be applied to microarray too. In this case, given a set of samples, we start by ranking the genes in each sample. We then normalize the ranking to be between 0 and 1, i.e., we divide by the total number of genes available in that sample. Then, given a list of 50 stable genes across cancer (Bhuva, Cursons, and Davis 2020), we calculate the average ranking of these genes in the sample and then for each gene in the sample we divide by this average.\n\n2.1.1 Selecting stable genes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step is to check what number of these 50 genes are available on TCGA and METABRIC, as these datasets will be used for training the PCA projection. The total number of available genes is 44. Table 2.1 shows the name of the genes available in TCGA and METABRIC.\nNow we select the 1000 most variable genes across METABRIC and TCGA. Reducing the number of genes used when calculating the PCA helps in the future. Several publicly available datasets don’t have many genes available, therefore reducing the number of genes increases the chances of using this approach in other datasets.\nMoreover, the use of a large number of genes is used because if some of them are not available. We show in later sections that if some number of stable genes are missing, it will not affect the normalization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: (Table 2.1) Available stable genes in both TCGA and METABRIC cohorts.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Calculating the normalization\nWe will create subset of the summarised experiment objects to save these information. Moreover, since a summarized experiment object is being used, we can save the new normalization in the assays and the average ranking scores of the housekeeping genes in the column data colData. This way it is very easy to retrieve the information for the patients.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Comparison of coefficient of variation and standard deviation scores.\n\n\n\n\nThey are highly correlated values, so we stick to the coefficient of variation as it makes more sense in this kind of analysis.\n\n\n\nTable 2.3 shows the top 1000 genes along with their standard deviation. The stable genes are also added to the list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: (Table 2.3) Standard deviation of each gene in each condition and pooled standard deviation.\n\n\n\nOverall we can see that housekeeping genes have very low standard deviation across cohorts, which is good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4 shows a histogram with the distribution of the average ranking of the housekeeping genes for each sample in each cohort.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Distribution of the average ranking of the housekeeping genes defined previously for each cohort separately.\n\n\n\n\nThe average ranking are somewhat similar. For the two experiments where there are RNA-seq samples, the distribution is the same. For METABRIC, a microarray experiment, the distribution is shifted a bit below.\nFigure 2.5 shows histograms of gene expression from some important genes in breast cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Distribution of the gene expression levels of ESR1 and TFF1 in each one of the cohorts\n\n\n\n\nESR1 and TFF1 expressions are divided across ER status, as expected. The proliferation marker CCND1 is also highly expressed in all conditions.\n\n\n2.1.3 Checking robustness with respect of number of houesekeeping genes available\nWhen calculating the normalized data, a total of 44 housekeeping genes were used. Sometimes not all of these genes are available, therefore we will calculate the normalization using random subsets of 44 housekeeping genes with different random sizes. The sets will have a minimum of 20 genes and maximum of 44. The sampling of the set size is obtained by using a uniform distribution. We focus just on TCGA for simplicity. The correlation used in this case was the Pearson correlation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Correlation distribution for different subsets of housekeeping genes (HKGs). Each different subset has a different number of HKGs.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6 shows the different distributions given the subsets of housekeeping genes. All the correlation coefficients are close to 1. This means that if a subset of housekeeping genes are missing it is fine, as the others will compensate."

    "text": "2.2 Integrating TCGA and METABRIC using PCA\nThe next step is creating the framework where we can integrate any patient sample and compare each other, at least spatially. The approach is similar to some sort of unsupervised learning, where no labels or groups are specified, which is something common in algorithms for batch removal. By using PCA in some subset of TCGA and METABRIC, we should learn the idiosyncrasies of the RNA-seq and microarray technologies as well as batch effects general to datasets. Since these two cohorts are big ones, we assume that if there are common batch effects, they are represented on them.\nThe practical steps are: first subselect 1000 samples in total from METABRIC and TCGA. Train PCA using these 1000 samples. Validate the results by projecting the other samples. In the next section we show how robust the approach is when selecting the samples. In the next chapters we validate the projection in unseen cohorts.\nIntegrating as laid out here only uses molecular data, therefore patients might be close to each other but they might have very different clinical features. This should always be kept in mind.\n\n\n\nThe table below shows the molecular characteristics of the patients selected for the PCA training.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    cohort \n    basal \n    her2 \n    lumb \n    luma \n    normal \n    claudin-low \n  \n \n\n  \n    metabric \n    73 \n    74 \n    163 \n    224 \n    46 \n    68 \n  \n  \n    tcga \n    70 \n    28 \n    61 \n    177 \n    16 \n    0 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7 shows the embedding of the two datasets together of the 1000 samples used for training.

(A) Plot of the first two components colored by cohort. (B) Plot of the first two components colored by ER status. (C) Plot of the second and third components colored by cohort.

(F) Plot of the second and third components colored by INTCLUST, only METABRIC has an assigned value for this variable, NAs are TCGA samples.\n\n\n\n\nThe first three components correspond to the batch effect. The third component explains the ER status and the two cohorts are well inter mingled. When plotting the third and fourth components and coloring by the molecular subtype, we see a clear distinction, recapitulating the biology.\nThe plot below shows how the loadings of the first component are really concentrated around zero, so there are not actually specific genes that are accounting for the batch effects we see in the first component. We show latter that the genes that are the most important are the ones with high loading, so the tail of the distributions. In this sense there are really no genes in the tail of the loadings for PC1.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Different loadings for the first 4 components.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9 shows all the samples from TCGA and cohort projected into the molecular landscape. The samples are mixing well, the only thing is that METABRIC is a bit offset to the left bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Original PC3 and PC4 of all samples, including test and train samples, of TCGA and METABRIC.\n\n\n\n\nAnd Figure 2.10.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: Original PC3 and PC4 of all samples, including test and train samples, of TCGA and METABRIC.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to check if the integration made sense, it is possible to color by ER status, NPI for METABRIC samples and tumor/node stage for TCGA. To check ER signaling scores, the pathways Estrogen response early/late and \\(SET_{ER/PR}\\) are used to color the projection.\nFigure 2.11 shows the coloring by age.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: PC3 and PC4 of samples from TCGA and METABRIC colored by age.\n\n\n\n\nAge seems to be well mixed. Figure 2.12 shows the PCA colored by ER status.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: PC3 and PC4 of samples from TCGA and METABRIC colored by ER status.\n\n\n\n\nIt has a very good separation among the different patients. Figure 2.13 is the PCA embedding colored by NPI. Only METABRIC samples have this information.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.13: PC3 and PC4 of samples from METABRIC only colored by NPI.\n\n\n\n\nIt looks good, ER+ BC patients have lower NPI, which makes sense. Figure 2.14 shows the biplot colored by tumor purity.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.14: PC3 and PC4 of samples from METABRIC only colored by tumor purity.\n\n\n\n\nThe tumor purity is not a factor that is affecting the embedding as samples with low cellularity (< 40% of tumor cells) and high cellularity (> 70% of tumor cells) intermingle.\nMETABRIC has also inferred menopausal status for the patients, we use this information to check if there is any enrichment based on the patient menopausal status (Figure 2.15)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.15: PC3 and PC4 of samples from METABRIC only colored by menopausal status.\n\n\n\n\nWe don’t see any difference between the two status. We proceed now with the analysis using clinical factors from TCGA.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.16: PC3 and PC4 of samples from TCGA only colored by tumor stage and node stage.\n\n\n\n\nFor both tumor and node stage the samples seem to have mixed well, indicating the projection is not a function of the stages, as shown in Figure 2.16.\nAnd finally Figure 2.17 below shows the color by PAM50 molecular subtype.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.17: Corrected PC3 and PC4 of samples from TCGA and METABRIC colored by PAM50 molecular subtype.\n\n\n\n\nThe molecular subtypes are projected as expected, going from left to right there are the basal-like BC patients, going to HER2 and then they are split between luminal A and B. The normal like patients are in the top and closer to the luminal A, reflecting the biology.\nThe next figures show the ER signaling measures coloring the projections.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.18: biplot of PC3 and PC4 of samples from TCGA and METABRIC colored by the SET ER/PR score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.19: biplot of PC3 and PC4 of samples from TCGA and METABRIC colored by the hallmark estrogen response early.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.20: biplot of PC3 and PC4 of samples from TCGA and METABRIC colored by the hallmark estrogen response late\n\n\n\n\nIn all cases the mixing is relatively good. For \\(SET_{ER/PR}\\) you have a gradient going from the right to the left, showing again that patients on the far top right probably are those patients with better prognosis."

In this section we show that doing the normalization is necessary to get a good integration in the datasets.\nThe idea is similar as before, but instead of performing the qPCR-like normalization on the datasets, one would use the logFPKM values for TCGA and median intensity for microarray. The problem with this kind of approach also includes the fact that only other samples that went through this processing could be used in the pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.23: PCA projections colored by different factors and organized by different components.

    "section": "3.2 Missing genes",
    "text": "3.2 Missing genes\nGenes missing in publicly available datasets is very common. Usually this is due to processing pipelines or even data quality, therefore genes are removed. This should not be much of a problem, if the data is good enough, when calculating the qPCR-like normalization as it was shown before. The problem arises when multiplying the loadings obtained in the PCA with the normalized expression of the sample. If several genes are missing, 0s are added to the matrix and therefore the loadings for these genes cannot be used. Since 1000 genes were used, we investigate the loadings of genes and try to calculate a fuzziness score, indicating when the embedding should be trusted if genes are missing, and which genes are missing.\n\n3.2.1 Fuzziness score\nThe idea of the fuzziness score is that we use the loadings of the missing genes and calculate the cumulative sum of their absolute values. The higher this value the more it indicates the missing genes are important. We start by removing random genes from random samples of the SCANB cohort. Each sample will have a random number of genes removed from the set of 1044 genes. Then two scores are calculated, one for PC2 and another for PC3. We also calculate the fuzziness score for the top loading genes and the low loadings genes, to compare these values.\nWe start by comparing the scores from top loadings and low loading genes. For this we remove the top 50 loadings and bottom 50 loadings, in terms of absolute values. Figure 3.4 shows the cumulative sum of the absolute values from the top and bottom loadings respectively. See how important the top loadings are compared to the bottom loadings. A way of thinking of this is that the top loadings weights are much more important when calculating the embedding.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Cumulative sum of absolute values for the top loadings and bottom loadings as a function of the number of selected genes.\n\n\n\n\nThis was using the top loadings, so probably the fuzziness score of a sample with relatively good data will be between 0 and 12 maximum, meaning that they have less than 200 genes missing. When genes are missing, we hope that they are in the bottom part of the loadings, so the fuzziness score is as small as possible.\nSuppose now that the genes missing in a sample are random. We will calculate random fuzziness scores based on this to have a feeling of the scores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Distribution of the fuzziness scores from random missing genes. Each color corresponds to a different distribution using a different number of genes.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5 shows the results as a function of the number of missing genes. We see that in average, if 200 genes are missing, the fuzziness score is around 5. If less than a 100 genes are missing, the fuzziness score is around 3. In the next section we show how this influences the position where the sample is projected into the embedding.\nFinally, we calculate the fuzziness score as a number of top loadings missing. Suppose 150 genes are missing. We will change the proportion of genes that are in the top loadings and in the missing list. Since the cumulative sum for PC2 and PC3 are very similar, we focus only on PC2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Distribution of the fuzziness scores from 150 random missing genes with different proportions of top loading genes in the list. Each color corresponds to a different distribution using a different proportion of genes.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6 shows the fuzziness score with different proportions of the top loading genes. We see that they are actually very important when calculating the score. The top loading genes were defined as the top 150 genes in the list. So when calculating the number of missing genes it is important to check the number of top loadings in the list.\n\n\n3.2.2 Validating the score\nIn this section we calculate the embeddings with different number of genes missing from a given sample and then plot the original embedding with the newly one. For this we use samples from TCGA. The genes are removed even before the normalization procedure, as they are usually not available there. We select randomly a number of top genes from PC3 and PC4 to compose the list of missing genes. The proportion of the top loading genes is varied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTCGA-OL-A66K-01A-11R-A29R-07TCGA-GI-A2C9-01A-11R-A21T-07TCGA-3C-AALK-01A-11R-A41B-07TCGA-BH-A0BW-01A-11R-A115-07TCGA-A1-A0SI-01A-11R-A144-07TCGA-D8-A27L-01A-11R-A16F-07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.9: ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.10: ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.11: ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.12: ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen looking at the figures above, it seems that whenever there are genes missing, and the more of top loadings they are, the closer they are to the origin. This makes sense, since PCA is doing a simple linear combination of the loadings. This should be fine to correct, since we can fit a line going through the origin and goes through the points above. Then the adjustment will depend on the number of genes that are missing and are top loadings. The more they are, the more adjustment we will need.\nFor the adjustment we only know two things, its current position and how many of the top loadings are missing. Based on this information we should be able to correct the samples. Given the list of genes that are missing, we fit lines that would go through the genes that are missing in the TCGA and METABRIC samples. We then try to find the line that is closes to the point. After performing the fit and the line, we can then move the point to closer to the METABRIC and TCGA samples. The point should be close to the line and close to points that have the same proportion of top loadings missing.\n\n\n\nThese plots show how the fuzziness score might be indicative of how good the embedding will be depending on the number of missing genes. The video below shows the images for 20 different patients. Notice how all of them are connected to the origin as well."

ER+ breast cancer samples coming from patients are processed in a specific way and injected into the mammary glands of mice. Based on that they can stablish themselves and proliferate. The environment should recapitulate what is seen in women as well, in the sense that estrogen (E2) levels are similar to those of post-menopausal women. Since these cells have to proliferate in order to establish and grow in the ducts, we expect them to be more proliferative in terms of RNA-seq components and also to lie in the luminal B region of the molecular landscape. We validate this now.\n\n\n\nWhen checking the total number of genes missing, there are only 27 genes missing. And as seen before, this number is almost irrelevant, in the sense that the embedding will still be robust and locations will be precise enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.15: Biplot of first two PCA components from PDX, TCGA, SCANB and METABRIC.

On the other hand, another set of PDXs, the last three, they didn’t see much change.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.19: Comparison of position in the molecular landscape between CTRL, E2 and P4 treated samples\n\n\n\n\nWhat we can see from these scores is that if there is an increase in G2M checkpoint and the control samples have scores below 0, then the fourth principal component will change it is value, it will go upwards and to the left in the molecular landscape, reflecting the biological response of the tumors to the given hormones.\nWe now further validate the results with the stainings performed on those samples. We will compare the differences with the stainings and the number of Ki67+ tumors cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.20: Quantification of Ki67+ cells based on DAB stainings performed on the patient derived xenografts.\n\n\n\n\nWe see that T111 has a big increase in absolute values. T113 as well has a big increase, but has a baseline level already low and it does not go to higher values. Probably the reason there is not much difference in the fourth component of the PDX T113 is because of the low Ki67 index.\nBased on the data shown here we see that there is an increase in proliferation upon P4 treatment for T111 and T113. Moreover, P4 reduced estrogen signaling and also change the third component of the three PDXs to a smaller value, towards a more basal like region. Overall, the molecular landscape is able to capture the differences between the treatments."

The farthest to the right you are the higher the ER signaling scores are also. Here we hypothesized then that the third component is correlated to the prognostic nature of the estrogen signaling score. For this we select only samples with PC3 higher than 0, as these would be the ones that are from luminal A and B subtypes and we use PC3 as a score in the survival analysis.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    cohort \n    number_patients \n    nb_events \n  \n \n\n  \n    SCANB \n    3144 \n    532 \n  \n  \n    METABRIC \n    724 \n    445 \n  \n  \n    SCANB High ER \n    2521 \n    394 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nFirst we check the correlation of PC3 with estrogen response early and G2M checkpoint.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is indeed the correlation with the components but still a lot of variability. So it will be unlikely to see such strong effects on the third component.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below shows the results for the survival analysis using all the samples from SCANB and METABRIC coming from patients that received only endocrine therapy and whose samples had a \\(PC3 > 0\\). OS means overall survival and RFS means recurrence free survival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that in all cases the HR for PC3 is below 1, for OS the values are 0.98 and 0.97 and the HR and for RFS from 0.80 to 0.93. What is interesting to note here is that in all cases the confidence interval is crossing 1, as expected due to the variability of the correlation with SET ER/PR and estrogen response early. Remember that the hazard ratio scale is not linear. Indeed it seems that the more a sample is on the right side of the plot the better is its outcome. Notice that the scale for HR is different for PC3 and SET ER/PR, since one is a positive score ranging from 0 to 8 and the other is a score ranging from -1 to 1. If we were to rescale SET ER/PR to an interval between 0 to 10 by multiplying by 5 and then summing 5, we would get hazard ratios in the range of 0.8. Moreover, estrogen signaling is not the only thing fully explaining the third component as it can be seen from Figure 2.25. In this case, G2M Checkpoint and PI3K signaling have also a role in the third component.\nThe following figures correspond to the overall survival analysis and recurrence free survival analysis from the SCANB and METABRIC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.24: Overall and recurrence free survival analysis of the principal components PC3 and PC4.

We want to evaluate if the position in the molecular landscape is somehow correlated with the risk score, specially in the forth component for luminal A patients.\nIn (Staaf et al. 2022) they showed that they are able to predict the Prosigna binary categories high or low/intermediate risk for the patients based only on the RNA-seq provided by their pipeline. We use these categories here to understand the molecular scores of the samples and also their correlation with the position and risk groups. All the following analysis are done for ER+ BC patients only.\nFirst we stratify the risk groups by the molecular subtype.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected the majority of luminal A patients are low/intermediate risk, on the other hand most of the luminal B patients are considered of high risk.\nIf we look more specifically for luminal A patients and stratify on the tumor stage we get the following numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that for tumor stage 1 the number of high individuals is lower in percentage than in tumor stage 3, as expected. We now plot (Figure 3.25) for all these patients the G2M molecular score, an index of proliferation, stratified by the tumor stage.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.25: Luminal A BC patients G2M scores stratified by tumor stage.\n\n\n\n\nWe see that in all three cases in average the G2M scores are higher in the high risk groups than in the Low/Intermediate.\nWe saw previously that some of the G2M checkpoint genes have higher loadings for the fourth component. We now plot the PC4 components stratified by the risk groups for the luminal A patients (Figure 3.26).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.26: Luminal A BC patients PC4 values stratified by risk category.\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, in average the higher the PC4, the more likely it is to be in the High risk group.

    "text": "This chapter we present a new way to think about the personalized medicine, by incorporating patient molecular information and its context. We saw previously that by using different cohorts, we can embed new patients into a point cloud. The idea is that the neighborhood of the patients are similar in the molecular level, and we can draw conclusions based on this.\nEach patient can be assigned a score. Scores represent a biological pathway, or in other words, a biological activity. Given a biological process, there is usually a set of genes that represent it. We can then use these set of genes to calculate scores that are proxies of this biological activity.\nFor example, in the previous chapters we used the ER signaling scores to motivate the continuity of ER signaling. This is not restricted to this specific pathway, we could have used any other list of genes representing a process.\nBy combining a score and the neighborhood of a patient, we can make direct comparisons and questions. Given a patient, how different is its score for a pathway compared to its neighbors? Is there also an alternative pathway that could be target and has a higher signaling? In this case specifically, is ER signaling more or less expressed compared to its neighbors?\nThe POETIC trial (Gao et al. 2019) is a breast cancer trial that had as hypothesis neoadjuvant therapy could improve overall and recurrence free survival. They gave aromatase inhibitors (AIs) for ER+ BC patients for 2 weeks prior to surgery and then 2 weeks after surgery. Moreover, they collected a needle biopsy before the treatment started and a biopsy in the surgery. They also measured the Ki67 levels, therefore we have a proxy on how well these patients responded in the short term to AIs. Also, they sent the tissues for sequencing, so microarray data is available. This is a unique cohort, in the sense that we can understand what are the responders or not, in terms of Ki67 levels, and use the molecular data to try to understand the responsiveness. The definition of responders are those patients that have a reduction of at least 60% in Ki67 levels when comparing pre-treatment versus surgery.\nHere we use this cohort to draw conclusions on responders and non responders and how the molecular landscape can be used. We show that some patients that are close to each other in the molecular landscape can have different pathway scores and therefore have different responses."

Therefore, we can look at patients in a neighborhood and calculate the average scores, to see what it means to be in a specific neighborhood.\nTo do this, we define a radius for a patient where all the patients within the euclidean ball with this radius will be selected and an average score distribution is calculated.\nTo calculate the average score distribution we use the rstanarm package. We set the prior distribution for the intercept to be a normal distribution centered at 0 with standard deviation of 1. All scores are in a range of -1 to 1, so this is a relatively flat prior for our use case.\nThe video below shows how scores change in average when comparing different neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing from right to left it shows how ER signaling is decreased. From top to bottom there is a reduction of proliferation, E2F targets, and a change in EMT and TGFb signaling. These are representative scores, other pathways could be used as well."

The data for this dataset was downloaded and processed as described at chronchi.github.io/transcriptomics in the chapter AI - GSE105777.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1 Number of samples\nIn this dataset there are matched samples from patients that are treated and untreated.

Among them, 39 are the housekeeping genes. Out of the 36 genes missing, a total number of 8 are missing from the top 200 PC3 loadings, a proportion of 4%. A total number of 5 are missing from the top 200 PC4 loadings, a proportion of 2%. These are very small proportions, and we have seen from the last chapter that they will not affect the position of the patients in the embedding.\n\n\n4.2.3 Embedding\nFigure 4.1 shows a good mixing of the POETIC sample and how all the patients are scattered across the whole landscape. Here all samples are plotted, meaning that every two dots correspond to a single patient.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: PCA embedding of all samples from TCGA, SCANB and METABRIC including the POETIC samples on top.

    "text": "4.3 Scoring all samples\nIn the last chapters scores were showed for TCGA, SCANB and METABRIC. Figure 2.18 shows how ER signaling changes as patients move across the molecular landscape. We intend to use the scores now for the POETIC samples. We first start by calculating using GSVA as well and include in the dataframe with the other cohorts. Before moving to the next chapter, we will analyse and compare the scores across the responders and non responders.\nFigure 4.4 shows that when using the scores, it looks like in average at baseline \\(SET_{ER/PR}\\) is lower in non responders than in responders. For the other scores there is no clear difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Baseline scores for all treated patients in the POETIC trial. G2M corresponds to a proliferation score, EMT to epithelial to mesenchymal transition score and the others are related to ER signaling.\n\n\n\n\nWe see that for PC3 and SET ER/PR There are some differences in terms of the responders and non responders.\nLet us take a closer look at those patients. We start by plotting the scatter plot of PC3 vs SET ER/PR and color by response status defined by the POETIC trial.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Comparison of the third component with SET ER/PR scores colored by response status.\n\n\n\n\nThis figure shows that there is a correlation between third component and SET ER/PR for the POETIC trial data as well as it was already seen from the other cohorts. Moreover, it seems that the responders have higher PC scores in general. We now correlate for each subgroup (responder and non responders) the PC3 and the change in percentage for Ki67.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Correlation between change in Ki67 versus PC3 stratified by response group.\n\n\n\n\nNow another metric we can calculate from our dataset is the difference of the embedding positions between the different samples of the same patient. The idea is that if a patient responded well, there were bigger changes as well in the transcriptomics and that is reflected in the embedding.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: Differences of the embeddings for each patient individually stratified by response status. Each dot corresponds to a single patient.\n\n\n\n\nAnd now we perform a comparison of these positions by using rstanarm to get the posterior distributions of the differences.\n\n\n\nThe figure below shows the distribution of the averages of the differences in the embedding of the projections.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: Differences of the embeddings for each patient individually stratified by response status.

    "section": "4.4 Analysing patient neighborhoods",
    "text": "4.4 Analysing patient neighborhoods\nThere are two ways to interpret the embedding. If the patient has ER+ BC and its embedding is close to the ER- BC patients, we can infer that the endocrine response might not work so well, as it was shown in Figure 4.2. The other option is to compare the patient’s score to the average score of its neighborhood.\nWhat is a neighborhood? When performing the embedding, global structures are not preserved usually. In this sense we only compare patients that are close to each other in an euclidean neighborhood, i.e., we calculate a radius around each sample and see what other samples are within this ball given the euclidean distance.\nGiven a neighborhood, one can calculate the posterior average score of all samples from METABRIC, SCANB and TCGA and use that as an indication of average score that we can compare other patients to. The concept is that if an ER+ BC patient has a much lower ER signaling score, it means the patients will not respond so well to endocrine therapy, as they are very different from their neighboors.\nTo showcase the ability to use the scores and infer results, we use the POETIC trial patients to compare the scores. This cohort is special in the sense that the patients are filtered based on selection criterias, meaning that the patients are clinically similar.\nTwo random patients in very close neighborhoods were selected to showcase the ability of the molecular landscape. The id of the patients are 63 and 236. Table 4.3 shows the clinical features of these patients. One of them is HER2+. Patient 63 had a higher Ki67 baseline level but a very good response to endocrine therapy. Patient 236 did not respond to endocrine therapy in terms of reduction of Ki67 levels.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.3:  Clinical features from patients 63 and 236. \n \n  \n    patient_nb \n    er_status \n    her2_status \n    ki67 \n    change_ki67 \n    ccca_surgery_ki67_2_7 \n  \n \n\n  \n    63 \n    pos \n    Positive \n    16.60702 \n    -69.958509 \n    noCCCA \n  \n  \n    236 \n    pos \n    Negative \n    11.30906 \n    5.593711 \n    noCCCA \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.10 shows the embedding of two distinct patients in a similar neighborhood.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.10: Plot of two selected patients in the molecular landscape. One is a responder and the other is a non responder. The patient id numbers are 63 and 236.\n\n\n\n\nAnd now we calculate the average scores for each patient neighborhoods. We start by defining a radius value. After that we select the patients in the neighborhood and use rstanarm to get the posterior distribution of the average score in the neighborhood. For this we use the function stan_glm to calculate the average. This is effective because it can be paired with the package tidybayes for plotting. It makes extremely easy to deal with posterior data. For the average we use a normal prior centered at 0 with 1 standard deviation, since all scores are between -1 and 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatient 63 Figure 6.8 is considered a responder. According to the scores, when comparing the estrogen early signature to its average distribution in the neighborhood, the score is higher.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.11: Posterior distribution of the average scores in the neighborhood of patient 236 from POETIC trial. Each dot corresponds to a 1% quantile.\n\n\n\n\nPatient 236 Figure 6.9 was considered a non responder. According to the scores, when comparing the estrogen early signature to its average distribution in the neighborhood, the score is lower, being in the 5% quantile.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.12: Posterior distribution of the average scores in the neighborhood of patient 236 from POETIC trial. Each dot corresponds to a 1% quantile.\n\n\n\n\nWhen comparing these two patients, there is also a difference in the androgen response score, which could be a reflection of different estrogen signaling.\n\n4.4.1 Analysing all patients\nWe now try to extend this comparison to something more systematic. Instead of looking just for these two patients we will compare the neighborhoods for the top responders and non-responder patients. The first thing we have to have in mind is that some non responders they did respond to the drug, just the reduction in Ki67 was not so big. For example patient 209 has a reduction of 40% in Ki67 going from 16% to 9%. Still this patient is considered a non-responder.\n\n\n\nWe don’t select all patients for the comparisons. We select only patients that are at least in the HER2 enriched region to the right, so we exclude the basal like patients. The reason for this as well is because they all either have low Estrogen response early scores or low SET ER/PR.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n      \n    HALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_EARLY \n    SET_ERPR \n    PC3 \n  \n \n\n  \n    treated_nb69_baseline \n    -0.265 \n    -0.50 \n    -4.5 \n  \n  \n    treated_nb76_baseline \n    -0.275 \n    -0.19 \n    -4.1 \n  \n  \n    treated_nb80_baseline \n    -0.013 \n    -0.49 \n    -5.6 \n  \n  \n    treated_nb229_baseline \n    -0.234 \n    -0.54 \n    -4.7 \n  \n  \n    treated_nb230_baseline \n    -0.308 \n    -0.50 \n    -7.5 \n  \n  \n    treated_nb237_baseline \n    -0.377 \n    -0.29 \n    -7.9 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.1.1 Non-responders\n\n\n\n\n\nEstrogen score still close to 0, high proliferation at baseline and higher androgen score. But in this case SET ER/PR is lower than average. There is a mismatch.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis patient has a score close to 0 still but low proliferation in general. This is a case where the EMT signaling is really at average and TGFb is super low. Again SET ER/PR is much lower, mismatch with ER signaling.\n\n\n\n\n\nEstrogen signaling close to 0, high androgen and E2F targets and high EMT. Intriguing patient, both ER and SET ER/PR are going in the same direction and above average.\n\n\n\n\n\nLow ER signaling and super high EMT with an increase P53 pathway expression. Super low ER signaling here in terms of SET ER/PR.\n\n\n\n\n\nLow ER score, even lower than average and low EMT signaling. Average E2F targets and lower than average for SET ER/PR.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis case is a bit different, the ER signaling is higher, E2F targets at baseline is not so high, even lower than the average, but in this case androgen response is much higher and EMT is extremely high. There is a relative mismatch between ER early and SET ER/PR. SET ER/PR is relatively small and close to the average.\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrogen score lower than the average and high E2F targets at baseline. In this case we see a very small EMT signature. In this case there is again a mismatch between ER signaling and SET ER/PR.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis one has a low ER signaling as well and higher E2F targets score. Massive difference in SET ER/PR here when comparing to the average.\nIn general all these non responders with no change in Ki67 had a low ER signaling score or a mismatch between ER early and SET ER/PR\n\n\n4.4.1.2 Top responders\nWe now investigate the top responders with the biggest decrease in Ki67.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst thing is that this patient had already a positive score and a very low Androgen signaling score. Moreover the Ki67 is low. This is one of the furthest patients to the right and still has a low ER signaling score.\n\n\n\n\n\nA bit high E2F targets but higher than average of the estrogen signaling score. High SET ER/PR.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere the ER signaling is above average and androgen response is similar to the average. E2F targets is high. Also super high SET ER/PR.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery low E2F targets and low Androgen response. ER is about the average. SET ER/PR is still positive. This sample is in the luminal A region also.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case ER signaling is also above average and E2F targets is similar to the average of neighbors. SET ER/PR on average and in the expected direction.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis one is intriguing, ER signaling is extremely low, E2F targets is very low as well but the patient responded pretty well. But there is a big mismatch between Ki67 and transcriptomics for this patient. Further investigation should be performed. Actually probably the samples have mixed names. Below are the values of the pathways after treatment:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks super weird that there is a big increase in proliferation based on the transcriptomic data considering the reduction in the Ki67 percentage. Not only that, ER signaling increases. It is very likely that the sample has a mixed label.\nMoving to the next one.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis one also is intriguing, estrogen signaling is very low but the patient is a responder with a good decrease in Ki67. Below is a table with the values for surgery and baseline. We see that there is indeed a decrease in proliferation and also in estrogen signaling. Also this sample is closer to the normal like and luminal A region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd last patient.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis patient has a score slightly higher than the average, but still negative. Nonetheless, the patient responded well to the therapy. One note is that this patient is close to the HER2 enriched region.\nIn general non responders had more mismatches between SET ER/PR and below average values than responders.\n\n\n4.4.1.3 Responders in the middle of embedding\nWe lastly check the responders that are in the middle of the molecular landscape to see how they are.\n\n\n\n\n\nLow ER signaling in both cases. This patient specifically had very high Ki67 levels at baseline.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso ER signaling is low here compared to the average, but a very low Ki67 proliferation index at baseline.\n\n\n4.4.1.4 Conclusion\nIn general what we can see is that when comparing responders and non responders the main difference is in the position of the molecular landscape. If we select the top responders and the top non-responders in terms of decrease of Ki67 index, we see that non responders have way lower third principal component (Figure 4.13).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.13: PC3 comparison of the top non responders and responders"

For this we already saw that in average the patients further to the left are non-responders and further to the right would be responders, suggesting a predictive power of the molecular landscape. The landscape still is not perfect as there is a lot of overlap between the responders and non-responders. So we try to use more principal components to capture the differences.\nJust when randomizing the train test split, we need to make sure that we include some of the samples that are in the basal like region in both splits, since they are in small numbers. Due to the small sample size, we use the components starting from 3 and going up to 20.\n\n\n\nIn this dataset the total of responders vs non responder is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 2/3 are responders. Using a set seed for the randomization, the numbers of responders and non responders are shown below for the training set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd for the test set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we compare the PC3 values distributions to see if they are equally distributed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are similarly distributed, so we can proceed with the training and testing strategy.\n\n\n\nThe plot below shows the misclassification error versus the lambda used for the penalization term in the logistic regression.\nThe plot below shows the misclassification error for different \\(\\lambda\\) values and number of components.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall the misclassification is pretty similar for all number of variables.

    "text": "Several risk signatures were developed over the years using transcriptomic datasets. Some examples were given in the previous chapters, such as OncotypeDX, Prosigna and EndoPredict. They were all derived in a similar manner, subsetting genes related to usually estrogen and proliferation signaling and then using recurrence free survival data to calculate the risk scores.\nIn this chapter we introduce a new risk score that does not subset genes and uses the information of the molecular landscape. The concept is simple, we will use the third and fourth components as covariates in the survival modeling along with tumor size and node status. This way we avoid subsetting and selecting specific genes and we use all the information the molecular landscape is providing us. Also it avoids any kind of binning for patients based on molecular subtype, thus not being necessary calculating correlations with pre-defined molecular subtypes.\nLater in the chapter we compare the risk score with the ROR binary categories: high and low/intermediate risk. We also compare the risk score with the ROR continuous value obtained by the SCANB team using nearest centroid classification (NCN). We use samples from patients that were treated with endocrine therapy only for the training of the risk score. Even though the ROR was trained on a cohort of patients that received no treatment, we can still compare the signatures. Buus et al. (2021) showed that the EndoPredict signature is highly correlated to ROR (\\(\\rho = 0.68\\)), therefore we can to some extent take conclusions based on the ROR signature.\nWe develop a risk score for early stage breast cancer patients that received only endocrine therapy (ET). The idea is similar to what was done with the EndoPredict signatures, but here we extend it by using the molecular landscape information. This provides a full framework where we can analyse the risk of recurrence even for patients that have high ER+ percentage."

Note though that the analysis still is a bit limited due to the followup time that in median is 5.3 years.\nWe also compare the risk score for the high risk group and low/intermediate risk group of the ROR signature (Figure 5.2) obtained by the SCANB team using single sample predictor models, where rule based algorithms are used to determine if a patient is high or low/intermediate risk. They validate this on prosigna’s own sequencing and showed good results (Staaf et al. 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Risk score stratified by binary category risk as defined by the SCANB team at (Staaf et al. 2022). ER+ BC patients that received only ET were considered.\n\n\n\n\nAs expected most of the patients in the high risk group are luminal B. The ROR signature was developed in such a way to get luminal B patients to be of high risk. But here we see that there is still an overlap between low/intermediate patients and high risk patients, suggesting that the new risk score has additional information. For assessing this hypothesis we perform recurrence free survival analysis with both variables and just the risk score and compare the likelihood of the two models using anova.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Deviance Table\n Cox model: response is  Surv(time = rfs_months, event = rfs_status)\n Model 1: ~ tumor_size + node_status + age + SSP.ROR.binary.risk.cat\n Model 2: ~ risk_score + SSP.ROR.binary.risk.cat + tumor_size + node_status + age\n   loglik  Chisq Df P(>|Chi|)  \n1 -1520.9                      \n2 -1518.4 5.0919  1   0.02404 *\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nWe see that by adding the risk score it provides aditional value on top of the binary category from prosigna. On top of that the SCANB team calculated also the ROR score based on the original paper. So we actually have the actual scores derived from the nearest centroid technique for all patients.\nFigure 5.3 shows the comparison between risk score and the ROR score from prosigna calculated by using NC.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Comparison of the risk score developed here with the ROR from Prosigna.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a correlation but we see that among the luminal A patients there are still those that have high risk score besides a ROR lower than 50.

    "text": "6.2 Removing the batch effects\nWe now try to remove the batch effects by removing all the PCs that are not of interest, so we remove the first two components and the fifth as well. We then calculate the scores for each cohort separately and then compare to what was calculated before. We can then try to calculate the scores using samples coming from all cohorts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general it looks good, the luminal B population is a bit compressed towards the luminal A population though.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a very good merging of the datasets. We see mostly green points because they are the majority.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we see that the first loadings has a tail in a similar fashio as the other loadings.\nWe now try to calculate the scores of the samples using these new embeddings only from TCGA samples as we will compare the results later on.\n\n\n\nAnd we can now check and compare the scores.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that for the three pathways the correlation is positive and strong. The difference is that it is a bit noisy, so the correlation is not perfect. What is interesting to see is that at the extremes the scores have less variation usually.\nWe now calculate the scores from SCANB and compare the results. Remember that SCANB was not used for the PCA training.\n\n\n\nAnd we can now check and compare the scores.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same phenomenon happened. Samples in the endges have lower variability, but samples in the middle are the ones that have high variability. For example there are several samples from the regressed data with SET_ERPR score close to 0.25 and negative scores.\nWhat happens now if we use another dataset and then use only one sample to calculate the score. Let us include SCANB samples in the pipeline. For this we select 50 scanb samples and 100 random samples from tcga and metabric. We then combine all these samples together and calculate the GSVA scores.\n\n\n\nWe now plot only the scores from the SCANB samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it seems there are still dataset related problems there when calculating the scores. The scores are positively correlated, but they are not quite the same as only using the SCANB dataset. Moreover, for G2M checkpoint the scores are concentrated around -0.4 from the regressed data but they are in a range going from - 0.4 to 0.1 in the unregressed data.\nIf we try to instead add some samples from the SCANB dataset as well randomly into the mix. How well does the scores get compared to the “ground truth”?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt does not work so well when including some SCANB samples together with the METABRIC and TCGA samples. We are trying to achieve a correlation of almost 1 with very low variability since we want to use the scores clinically.\nLet us check the distribution of some genes for SCANB and TCGA after regressing out the first two PCs.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that even though the expression profile of the samples are overlapping there are discrepancies. That is why when using GSVA it does not work so well perhaps."

    "section": "6.3 Scoring strategy with regressed data",
    "text": "6.3 Scoring strategy with regressed data\nWe now try to use a slightly different scoring strategy. We can think of our data in a log scale, so what we do now instead is to sum all of our genes of interest and then subtract an average of the housekeeping genes expression levels.\nFirst we check the distribution of this average for each cohort separately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Distribution of the average of the housekeeping genes for distinct cohorts.\n\n\n\n\nIndeed the tcga and metabric cohorts have an overlapping distribution, but the SCANB does not overlap completely, it is actually shifted. One should still take into account that the distributions are very close to 0, meaning that the housekeeping genes have very close to 0 values, as expected here in this case. We now calculate the score by taking this into account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: Scores obtained from regressed data of all the four cohorts TCGA, SCANB, METABRIC and POETIC compared to the original GSVA scores.\n\n\n\n\nThe scores are actually highly correlated, specially the estrogen related pathways. Also the correlation between the scores in general follows the same trends.\nThe plot below is a subset of the scores above to include in the publication.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: Scores obtained from regressed data of all the four cohorts TCGA, SCANB, METABRIC and POETIC compared to the original GSVA scores.\n\n\n\n\nWe now compare the distributions of these scores. Across the different cohorts and pathways of interest.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd with all molecular subtypes together.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the overlap is actually pretty good in general, even for SCANB. The only part where there is a bigger discrepancy is for G2M checkpoint. We see below that by calculating the GSVA score on the whole scanb cohort we don’t have this problem.\nAnd as a comparison we plot with the original scores using GSVA on the whole cohort individually.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd all the subtypes together for the original score:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that by doing GSVA the distributions they overlap much more than using the regressed data and the simple sum of the values for those genes. Still for estrogen signaling it seems that the estrogen early signature is pretty robust.\n\n6.3.1 Checking the patients from POETIC with new scores\nWe now use the new scores to evaluate the comparison with the neighboorhood, just as before in the previous chapter where we used the POETIC trial data.\n\n\n\nPatient 63 Figure 6.8 is considered a responder. According to the scores, when comparing the estrogen early signature to its average distribution in the neighborhood, the score is higher.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: Posterior distribution of the average scores in the neighborhood of patient 63 from POETIC trial. Each dot corresponds to a 1% quantile.\n\n\n\n\nPatient 236 Figure 6.9 was considered a non responder. According to the scores, when comparing the estrogen early signature to its average distribution in the neighborhood, the score is lower, being in the 5% quantile.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.9: Posterior distribution of the average scores in the neighborhood of patient 236 from POETIC trial. Each dot corresponds to a 1% quantile.\n\n\n\n\nWhen comparing these two patients, there is also a difference in the androgen response score, which could be a reflection of different estrogen signaling.\nIt reflects what we saw previously as well.\n\n\n6.3.2 Responder vs non responder comparison of new scores\nWe now compare the scores for responders and non responders.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe higher E2F targets in average the lower the estrogen early score is for non responders, whereas this correlation does not exist for responder patients. This difference is mostly drive by the high E2F target non responder tumors.\nNow the plot below shows the correlation for baselien Ki67% and E2F targets for the score calculated in the regressed data in a single sample manner. We see a positive correlation between the two scores. Moreover, it is interesting to see that when the tumor has low Ki67, there is still a spectrum on the E2F targets score. Also there is no difference in the correlation between responders and non responders.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd lastly we compare the estrogen signaling signatures between responders and non-responder.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the estrogen response early has a wider range when compared to the SET ER/PR score. That makes sense as this signature has over 100 genes, whereas SET ER/PR has only 18. Also the responder was very good in discriminating the responders and non responders. What we can conclude from this figure is that the samples with very low scores are usually non responders, which reflect their position in the molecular landscape, also in general responders have higher ER signaling than non responders.\nBelow is the figure with the GSVA scores before regressing the data, we see that SET ER/PR is not able to really distinguish completely the non-responders with very low score similar to what was done with GSVA. Even estrogen early had some differences.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd below is a figure with both GSVA and regressed scores together.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.10: Comparing scoring strategies for responders and non responders in the POETIC dataset.\n\n\n\n\nBelow we show the correlation between these scores for all cohorts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese scores are highly correlated but in different absolute scales. We now check the change in Ki67 for all patients and compare the scores with the original ones obtained with GSVA.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.11: Comparison of original GSVA and regressed scores between responders and non responders compared to change in Ki67.\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the bigger the change the higher the score is when using the regressed data. Also the non responders tend to have scores mostly in the negative scale, whereas the responders are more shifted to the right. SET ER/PR is also a good measure here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a very good match between the two scores in general, meaning that the regression scoring strategy capture relatively well the scores. There is one patient that is a non-responder and has a low regressed estrogen early but a GSVA score close to 0, let us check this patient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a patient that is far to the left on the molecular landscape, among the basal like, and had an increase in Ki67 upon ET. So the new scoring system was able to capture this patient as with low score.\n\n\n6.3.3 Survival analysis with the new scores\nWe can check how robust these scores are by performing survival analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.12: Overall survival analysis from SCANB and METABRIC cohorts and their scores. The formulas used were the same as for the estrogen signaling analysis. Coefficients were scaled before performing cox regression\n\n\n\n\nThe plot with TCGA is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\nScores for TCGA are noisier than SCANB and METABRIC. Though the scaled scores they have comparable hazard ratios and also they follow what we saw previously. The only pathway that is a bit different is the PI3K AKT MTOR signaling. This pathway had a noisier correlation with the GSVA score as well."

Also it is the PDX with the lowest apoptosis and highest DNA repair, probably due to a higher replication rate. Moreover, all these PDXs they have a estrogen response early scores higher than 0 in average, which is about the average of the scores in the ER+ BC samples.\nNow we check what happens with some of the PDXs when they are treated with P4, to compare with Figure 3.19.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.15: Comparison of position in the molecular landscape between CTRL, E2 and P4 treated samples with the regressed data\n\n\n\n\nThe results are very similar to what was seen previously using the GSVA.

On the other hand we can’t use the pathways G2M checkpoint, E2F targets and EMT. For the PI3K signaling score it seems it is comparable to SCANB only."

Still it is ok.\nLet us now calculate the ROR for the ABiM cohort.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.20: Correlation between ROR obtained from prosigna assay and R package genefu\n\n\n\n\nThe correlation is relatively good and respects the molecular subtypes in general. The ROR obtained from genefu for some luminal B are not quite right as they are below 50.\nWe now move on to the other signatures: Mammaprint, EndoPredict (EP) and OncotypeDX Risk Score (RS).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.21: Correlation between ROR obtained from prosigna assay and the mammaprint signature obtained from the R package genefu\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.21 shows the correlation between the mammaprint signature (named GENE70) and the ROR from prosigna.\nLet us now compare the GENE70 signature with the risk score developed in the previous chapters. We use the ABiM 100 cohort to make the comparison. One side note, we are using only 51 out of the 70 probes available in the package. 15 probes don’t have any corresponding symbol. Out of the available genes, some are duplicated. For the duplicated genes, the correlation coefficients are all similar, so we can select just the first ocurrence in the list.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a good correlation between the two signatures, suggesting that the Mammaprint signature is somehow based on the position of the samples in the molecular landscape.\nWe now proceed and calculate the mammaprint scores for SCANB and METABRIC as well and only for ER+ BC samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.22: Embedding of ER+ BC samples colored by the mammaprint score.\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the pattern is very close to what we have from the risk score created in the previous chapter.

We know that by giving P4 estrogen signaling actually goes up, so a expected subtype change is from normal to either luminal A and B. Moreover, these PDXs are in an active state of proliferation due to the MIND model, so being in the normal like region is not a good indication. Also this results show that almost all PDXs would be normal like which does not go in hand with the results we get from the lab.\nAnd the probabilities are available below.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd another validation is using the normal cohort. Below is the number of all predicted molecular subtypes.\n\n\n\nNormal \n    66 \n\n\nAll samples are normal-like as expected, since they are normal. So it could be that the AIMS algorithm is not suited for PDXs but for clinical samples it works quite well."

One that works fairly well is the ER signaling score, but the others not so well. The proliferation score barely shows any difference between luminal A and B patients in any of the cohorts.\nPerhaps if we calculate the scores using the hallmarks pathways the scores are better correlated, since they are the same gene sets.\nBelow we plot the correlation between the proliferation pathway using GSVA and the regressed scoring strategy for the TCGA cohort.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is perfectly correlated.\nAnd for ER signaling:\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso it is very much correlated. So the problem in the end is comparing the hallmarks signatures with the nanostring. But interestingly the nanostring proliferation signature was not good to pick up the differences between luminal A and B."
