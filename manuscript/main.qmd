## Estrogen receptor is a clinical continuous variable

```{r}
#| label: fig-01
#| fig-cap: "Scores and survival analysis results from TCGA, SCANB and METABRIC
#|     cohorts. (a) GSVA scores for the SET ER/PR signature for each cohort.
#|     Each point corresponds to a patient sample and they are divided by
#|     estrogen receptor status. (b) Forest plot of the survival analysis
#|     for each cohort separately. NPI: Nottingham prognostic index. 
#|     Ti: i-th stage of tumor. Ni: i lymph nodes with breast cancer cells."

## Single sample integration preserves relevant breast cancer properties

```{r}
#| label: fig-02
#| fig-cap: > 
#|     (a) Biplot using the third and fourth components on TCGA and METABRIC
#|     samples. Colored by cohort. (b) Same as **a**, colored by ER status.
#|     (c) Same as **a**, colored by PAM50 molecular subtype. (d) Hex grid
#|     calculated on the biplot of the fourth and third component. Each hex 
#|     is colored based on its average value of the SET ER/PR signature.

## Embedding is robust to missing genes and generalized to a validation cohort

```{r}
#| label: fig-03
#| fig-cap: > 
#|     Validation of the molecular landscape with an external cohort
#|     (a) Biplot using the third and fourth components and now including
#|     all samples from the three cohorts: TCGA, METABRIC and SCANB.
#|     (b) Same as **a**, colored by ER status. 
#|     (c) Same as **a**, colored by PAM50 molecular subtype.
#|     (d) Biplot using the first and second component of TCGA, METABRIC and
#|     SCANB. 
#|     (e) Embedding of random samples given different training sets for 
#|     PCA.
#|     (f) Biplot of all possible embeddings of sample given a certain
#|     proportion of top loadings missing in the dataset.

## Molecular landscape is a tool to understand and reveal patient heterogeneity

```{r}
#| label: fig-04
#| fig-cap: > 
#|     Embedding of the POETIC cohort into the molecular landscape and
#|     pathway analysis for patient samples. (a) Biplots of the 
#|     POETIC samples (baseline and surgery) into the molecular landscape.
#|     Left plot is colored by ER status and right plot is colored by
#|     molecular subtype PAM50 when available. 
#|     (b) Biplot highlighting two patients with similar embedding and 
#|     different response status.
#|     (c) Posterior distributions of the average scores in the neighborhood
#|     of the responder patient. Red line corresponds to the patient score.
#|     (d) Posterior distributions of the average scores in the neighborhood
#|     of the **non**-responder patient. 
#|     Red line corresponds to the patient score.
