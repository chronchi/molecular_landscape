# Validating the molecular landscape

In the last chapters only TCGA and METABRIC samples were used in the training
and testing of the PCA projection. To completely validate, we use another
big cohort, SCANB, that was not used in the PCA fitting and testing before.
This way we ensure that the embedding is independent of the cohort. Moreover,
we use the SMC cohort [@Kan2018], whose patients are from South Korea and 
the data is microarray. We show how well it is embedded, and that 
is not dependent on population parameters.
