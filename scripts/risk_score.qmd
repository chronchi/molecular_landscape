# Risk score model

Several risk signatures were developed over the years using transcriptomic
datasets. Some examples were given in the previous chapters, such as 
OncotypeDX, Prosigna and EndoPredict. They were all derived in a similar
manner, subsetting genes related to usually estrogen and proliferation 
signaling and then using recurrence free survival data to calculate
the risk scores. 

In this chapter we introduce a new risk score that does not subset
genes and uses the information of the molecular landscape. The concept
is simple, we will use the third and fourth components as covariates in
the survival modeling along with tumor size and node status. This
way we avoid subsetting and selecting specific genes and we use all
the information the molecular landscape is providing us. Also it avoids
any kind of binning for patients based on molecular subtype, thus not being
necessary calculating correlations with pre-defined molecular subtypes.

Later in the chapter we compare the risk score with the ROR binary 
categories: high and low/intermediate risk. We also compare the risk score
with the ROR continuous value obtained by the SCANB team using nearest
centroid classification (NCN). We use samples from patients that were treated
with endocrine therapy only for the training of the risk score. Even though 
the ROR was trained on a cohort of patients that received no treatment, we 
can still compare the signatures. @Buus2021 showed that the EndoPredict 
signature is highly correlated to ROR ($\rho = 0.68$), therefore we can 
to some extent take conclusions based on the ROR signature.

We develop a risk score for early stage breast cancer patients that 
received only endocrine therapy (ET). The idea is similar to what was
done with the EndoPredict signatures, but here we extend it by using the
molecular landscape information. This provides a full framework where
we can analyse the risk of recurrence even for patients that have 
high ER+ percentage.

## Generating the risk score

We focus only on the endocrine treated patients. For the training part
of the algorithm we use a subset of patients from the METABRIC cohort.
We then test the risk scores in the test set and we further validate
the score on SCANB. 

We will generate two risk scores: one including only the principal 
components and another one including the clinical features of the 
patients when valiable, namely tumor size, node status and age (either having
one or more lymph node with breast cancer cells or none). 

```{r}
# start by preparing the datasets so it is easily used later
df_pca_metabric <- df_pca %>% 
    dplyr::filter(cohort == "metabric") %>%
    dplyr::mutate(TreatGroup = dplyr::case_when(
        HORMONE_THERAPY == "YES" & CHEMOTHERAPY == "YES" ~ "ChemoEndo",
        HORMONE_THERAPY == "YES" & CHEMOTHERAPY == "NO" ~ "Endo",
        TRUE ~ "Other"
    )) %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(node_status = ifelse(
        LYMPH_NODES_EXAMINED_POSITIVE > 0, 
        "pos",
        "neg"
    )) %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(
        node_status = factor(node_status, levels = c("neg", "pos")),
        tumor_size = TUMOR_SIZE
    )

df_pca_scanb <- df_pca %>% 
    dplyr::filter(cohort == "scanb") %>%
    dplyr::mutate(node_status = ifelse(
        node_group == "N0", 
        "neg",
        "pos"
    )) %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(node_status = factor(
        node_status, levels = c("neg", "pos")
    ))

# select only the endocrine treated patients
endo_only_scanb <- df_pca_scanb %>% 
    dplyr::filter(
            TreatGroup == "Endo" & 
            !is.na(rfs_status) & 
            !is.na(rfs_months) &
            er_status == "pos" &
            !is.na(age) &
            !is.na(tumor_size) &
            !is.na(node_status)
    )

endo_only_metabric <- df_pca_metabric %>% 
    dplyr::filter(
            HORMONE_THERAPY == "YES" & 
            CHEMOTHERAPY == "NO" &
            !is.na(rfs_status) & 
            !is.na(rfs_months) &
            er_status == "pos" &
            !is.na(age) &
            !is.na(tumor_size) &
            !is.na(node_status)
    )

# set the seed so we can reproduce the results later and then
# select the training cohort
set.seed(12938)
training_set <- endo_only_metabric %>%
    dplyr::slice_sample(prop = 0.6)

# we use the two PCs we have been investigating, but that does not mean
# other PCs can't be used
pcs_to_use <- paste0("PC", c(3:4))
clin_vars <- c("tumor_size", "node_status", "age")

risk_score_model <- survival::coxph(
    as.formula(paste0(
        "Surv(time = rfs_months, event = rfs_status) ~ ",
        paste(c(pcs_to_use, clin_vars), collapse = "+")
    )),
    data = training_set
)

saveRDS(
    risk_score_model,
    "../results/rds_files/risk_score/risk_score_model.rds"
)
```

```{r}
summary(risk_score_model)
```

We see that all coefficients have less variability than age. We still keep
all the variables when calculating the risk score, since age has a coefficient
relatively small we can keep it. 

Now we calculate only the risk score based on the components. 

```{r}
risk_score_model_pcs <- survival::coxph(
    as.formula(paste0(
        "Surv(time = rfs_months, event = rfs_status) ~ ",
        paste(c(pcs_to_use), collapse = "+")
    )),
    data = training_set
)

risk_score_model_clins <- survival::coxph(
    as.formula(paste0(
        "Surv(time = rfs_months, event = rfs_status) ~ ",
        paste(c(clin_vars), collapse = "+")
    )),
    data = training_set
)

saveRDS(
    risk_score_model_pcs,
    "../results/rds_files/risk_score/risk_score_model_pcs.rds"
)
```


```{r}
summary(risk_score_model_pcs)
```

We see that the coefficients are very similar to what was found before,
it didn't change much. Also when we include the principal components on the
top of the clinical variables the log likelihood increases, which is 
a good indication: 

```{r}
anova(risk_score_model_clins, risk_score_model)
```

```{r}
# first get the coefficients 
coefs_risk_model <- coef(risk_score_model)
coefs_risk_model_pcs <- coef(risk_score_model_pcs)

# let us save them so they can be used later as well
saveRDS(
    coefs_risk_model,
    "../results/rds_files/risk_score/coefs_risk_model.rds"
)
saveRDS(
    coefs_risk_model_pcs,
    "../results/rds_files/risk_score/coefs_risk_model_pcs.rds"
)

# now we can calculate the scores for all the patients. For TCGA and POETIC
# we do not have tumor size, so for those we calculate the risk score based
# on the components only.
endo_only_scanb$risk_score <- calculate_risk_score(
    coefs_risk_model, endo_only_scanb
)
endo_only_scanb$risk_score_pcs <- calculate_risk_score(
    coefs_risk_model_pcs, endo_only_scanb, is_node = FALSE
)
endo_only_metabric$risk_score <- calculate_risk_score(
    coefs_risk_model, endo_only_metabric
)
endo_only_metabric$risk_score_pcs <- calculate_risk_score(
    coefs_risk_model_pcs, endo_only_metabric, is_node = FALSE
)

df_pca_metabric$risk_score <- calculate_risk_score(coefs_risk_model, df_pca_metabric) 
df_pca_scanb$risk_score <- calculate_risk_score(coefs_risk_model, df_pca_scanb)

# we can now calculate the score for all samples based on PC3 and PC4
df_pca$risk_score_pcs <- calculate_risk_score(
    coefs_risk_model_pcs, 
    df_pca, 
    is_node = FALSE
)

test_set <- endo_only_metabric %>%
    dplyr::filter(!(sample_name %in% training_set$sample_name))

risk_score_test <- survival::coxph(
    Surv(time = rfs_months, event = rfs_status) ~ risk_score,
    data = test_set
)

risk_score_test_clins <- survival::coxph(
    Surv(time = rfs_months, event = rfs_status) ~ risk_score + 
        tumor_size,
    data = test_set
)
```

Now we use the test set to calculate the score.

```{r}
summary(risk_score_test)
```

We see that the higher the risk score the worse it is for the patients 
treated only with endocrine therapy. 

## Validating the risk score on SCANB

We can now validate the risk score on the SCANB dataset. 

```{r}
risk_score_scanb <- survival::coxph(
    as.formula(paste0(
        "Surv(time = rfs_months, event = rfs_status) ~ ",
        paste(c("risk_score"), collapse = "+")
    )),
    data = endo_only_scanb
)

summary(risk_score_scanb)
```

Again the risk score is prognostic with a high coefficient, meaning
that the higher the score the worse it is for the patient. 

We now visualize a bit the risk scores developed here in terms 
of the molecular landscape. @fig-risk-endo-pam50

```{r}
#| label: fig-risk-endo-pam50
#| fig-cap: Molecular landscape of SCANB patients treated with only
#|     endocrine therapy and that have ER+ breast cancer. Only patients
#|     with risk score less than 2 are plotted here. There are only 26
#|     patients out of 2829 with risk score higher than 2 that would skew 
#|     the color scale.
endo_only_scanb %>%
    ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = PC3, y = PC4, color = risk_score)) +
    ggplot2::geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.8) + 
    ggplot2::scale_color_viridis_c() + 
    ggplot2::theme_bw(base_size = 15) +
    ggplot2::labs(
        color = "Risk score",
        title = paste0(
            "Clinical risk score for SCANB patients treated with ET only"
        )
    ) +
    change_plot_aes_point()
```

We now investigate the risk score among patients that have high ER IHC
percentage as well. We have seen that these patients have different outcomes
based on the molecular estrogen signaling. We now investigate the effect
of the risk score. 

```{r}
risk_score_scanb_highER <- survival::coxph(
    as.formula(paste0(
        "Surv(time = rfs_months, event = rfs_status) ~ ",
        paste(c("risk_score"), collapse = "+")
    )),
    data = endo_only_scanb %>%
        dplyr::filter(ER.pct >= 90 & risk_score < 2)
)

summary(risk_score_scanb_highER)
```

We see that the score is still prognostic, meaning that even patients
that have high ER IHC percentage, there are those with higher risk. Note
though that the analysis still is a bit limited due to the followup time
that in median is `r format(median(endo_only_scanb$rfs_month)/12, digits = 2)` 
years.

We also compare the risk score for the high risk group and low/intermediate
risk group of the ROR signature (@fig-risk-ror) 
obtained by the SCANB team using single 
sample predictor models, where rule based algorithms are used to determine
if a patient is high or low/intermediate risk. They validate this on
prosigna's own sequencing and showed good results [@SCANB2022].

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
#| label: fig-risk-ror
#| fig-cap: Risk score stratified by binary category risk as defined 
#|     by the SCANB team at [@SCANB2022]. ER+ BC patients that received 
#|     only ET were considered.
endo_only_scanb %>% 
    ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = SSP.ROR.binary.risk.cat, y = risk_score, color = pam50)) +
    ggplot2::geom_jitter() + 
    ggplot2::geom_violin(color = "black", alpha = 0.3) +
    ggplot2::geom_boxplot(
        width=0.1, 
        color = "black", 
        alpha = 0.3,
        outlier.shape = NA
    ) +
    ggplot2::theme_bw(base_size = 15) +
    ggplot2::labs(
        x = "ROR binary risk category (SSP)",
        title = paste0(
            "Risk score stratified by the risk category.\n",
            "ER+ BC patients from SCANB treated only with ET"
        ),
        y = "Risk score"
    ) + 
    ggplot2::scale_color_manual(
       values = get_colors_pam50(endo_only_scanb)
    ) +
    change_plot_aes_point() + 
    change_guides_point()
```

As expected most of the patients in the high risk group are luminal B.
The ROR signature was developed in such a way to get luminal B patients to be
of high risk. But here we see that there is still an overlap between
low/intermediate patients and high risk patients, suggesting that the
new risk score has additional information. For assessing this hypothesis
we perform recurrence free survival analysis with both variables and just
the risk score and compare the likelihood of the two models using anova. 

```{r}
risk_score_scanb_ROR <- survival::coxph(
    as.formula(paste0(
        "Surv(time = rfs_months, event = rfs_status) ~ ",
        paste(c("risk_score", "SSP.ROR.binary.risk.cat", clin_vars), collapse = "+")
    )),
    data = endo_only_scanb
)

risk_score_scanb_onlyROR <- survival::coxph(
    as.formula(paste0(
        "Surv(time = rfs_months, event = rfs_status) ~ ",
        paste(c(clin_vars, "SSP.ROR.binary.risk.cat"), collapse = "+")
    )),
    data = endo_only_scanb
)

anova_out <- anova(risk_score_scanb_onlyROR, risk_score_scanb_ROR)
write.csv(
    broom::tidy(anova_out),
    "../results/tables/risk_score/anova_ROR_RR.csv"
)
```

```{r}
anova_out
```


We see that by adding the risk score it provides aditional value on top of 
the binary category from prosigna. On top of that the SCANB team calculated
also the ROR score based on the original paper. So we actually have the 
actual scores derived from the nearest centroid technique for all patients.  

@fig-ror-riskscore-comparison shows the comparison between risk score 
and the ROR score from prosigna calculated by using NC. 

```{r}
#| label: fig-ror-riskscore-comparison
#| fig-cap: Comparison of the risk score developed here with the ROR from
#|     Prosigna. 
endo_only_scanb %>% 
    ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = risk_score, NCN.ROR.asT0, color = pam50)) +
    ggplot2::geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
    ggplot2::theme_bw(base_size = 15) +
    ggplot2::labs(
        x = "Risk score",
        y = "ROR (by NC)",
        title = "Clinical risk score vs ROR for SCANB\npatients treated with ET only"
    ) +
    change_guides_point() +
    change_plot_aes_point()
```

There is a correlation but we see that among the luminal A patients 
there are still those that have high risk score besides a ROR lower than
50. We now evaluate the risk score only on luminal A patients that 
received just endocrine therapy.

```{r}
risk_score_scanb_luma <- survival::coxph(
    as.formula(paste0(
        "Surv(time = rfs_months, event = rfs_status) ~ ",
        paste(c("risk_score", clin_vars), collapse = "+")
    )),
    data = endo_only_scanb %>%
        dplyr::filter(pam50 == "luma")
)

risk_score_scanb_luma
```

Even among these patients the score is prognostic, despite the number of 
events, the hazard ratio is relatively high here. If we do the survival
analysis by using overall survival as endpoint the results are shown below.

```{r}
risk_score_scanb_luma_os <- survival::coxph(
    as.formula(paste0(
        "Surv(time = os_months, event = os_status) ~ ",
        paste(c("risk_score", clin_vars), collapse = "+")
    )),
    data = endo_only_scanb %>%
        dplyr::filter(pam50 == "luma")
)

risk_score_scanb_luma_os
```

Risk score still an estimated hazard ratio higher than 1, with 
more variability though, still in the expected direction. So we see that 
this signature provides aditional information to the PAM50 ROR signature. 

## Risk score and POETIC trial

We can evaluate one of the two risk scores, the one using only the 
principal components, in the POETIC trial data. The first question we
can address is if there is difference in scores in the baseline tissue 
(@fig-poetic-risk-score).

```{r}
#| label: fig-poetic-risk-score
#| fig-cap: Risk scores for responders and non-responders in the baseline
#|     tumor tissue. 
df_pca %>%
    dplyr::filter(
        cohort == "poetic" & 
            timepoint == "baseline" & 
            is_responder != "not_available"
    ) %>%
    ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = is_responder, y = risk_score_pcs)) +
    ggplot2::geom_violin(alpha = 0.3) + 
    ggplot2::geom_jitter() + 
    ggplot2::labs(
        x = "Response status",
        y = "Risk score (PCs only)",
        title = "Risk score (PCs only) based on response status"
    ) +
    ggplot2::theme_bw(base_size = 20) +
    change_plot_aes_point()
```

We see in the @fig-poetic-risk-score that in average the non responders
have higher risk scores. Now if we compare the risk scores between
baseline and surgery, the slope of the line that fits for each group
separately, responder and non responder, is different. The slope
for the non responders is parallel to the identity line going through
the origin with a slope of 1, meaning that there is not much change of risk
upon the treatment. On other hand, for the responder group the slope is
decreased and has a value lower than 1, meaning that the risk is decreased
upon aromatase inhibition after two weeks (@fig-poetic-risk-base-surgery).

```{r}
#| label: fig-poetic-risk-base-surgery
#| fig-cap: Comparison of risk scores using the PCs only before and after
#|     two weeks of aromatase inhibitors in post-menopausal women. The colored
#|     lines correspond do the linear regression for each response status
#|     group separately. 
df_pca %>%
    dplyr::filter(
        cohort == "poetic" & 
            is_responder != "not_available"
    ) %>%
    tidyr::pivot_wider(
        id_cols = c("patient_nb", "is_responder"),
        names_from = "timepoint",
        values_from = "risk_score_pcs"
    ) %>%
    ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = baseline, y = surgery, color = is_responder)) +
    ggplot2::geom_point() +
    ggplot2::geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") + 
    ggplot2::geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y ~ x") +
    ggplot2::labs(
        x = "Baseline risk score",
        y = "Surgery risk score",
        title = "Risk score (PCs only)",
        color = "Is responder?"
    ) +
    ggplot2::scale_color_viridis_d() + 
    ggplot2::theme_bw(base_size = 20) +
    change_plot_aes_point()
```

## Risk score vs pathways 

We now compare the risk score with pathways of interest as discussed in the
previous sections. Again we only look at the patients that received only
endocrine therapy in both SCANB and METABRIC.

```{r}
pathways_of_interest <- c(
    "HALLMARK_G2M_CHECKPOINT" = "G2M checkpoint",
    "HALLMARK_EPITHELIAL_MESENCHYMAL_TRANSITION" = "EMT",
    "HALLMARK_DNA_REPAIR" = "DNA repair",
    "HALLMARK_ANDROGEN_RESPONSE" = "Androgen response",
    "HALLMARK_PI3K_AKT_MTOR_SIGNALING" = "PI3K AKT MTOR signaling",
    "SET_ERPR" = "SET ER/PR",
    "HALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_EARLY" = "Estrogen early"
)

endo_only_sm <- dplyr::bind_rows(
    endo_only_scanb,
    endo_only_metabric
) %>% 
    dplyr::select(dplyr::all_of(c(
        names(pathways_of_interest),
        "cohort",
        "pam50",
        "risk_score",
        "risk_score_pcs"
    )))
```

```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=10}
#| label: fig-cor-risk-pathways
#| fig-cap: Risk score versus pathways of interest. Each subplot corresponds
#|     to a different pathway. 
endo_only_sm %>%
    tidyr::pivot_longer(
        cols = names(pathways_of_interest),
        names_to = "pathway",
        values_to = "score"
    ) %>%
    ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = risk_score, y = score)) +
    ggplot2::geom_point() +
    ggplot2::scale_color_manual(
        values = get_colors_pam50(endo_only_sm)
    ) +
    ggplot2::facet_wrap(
        ~pathway,
        labeller = as_labeller(pathways_of_interest),
        scales = "free_y"
    ) + 
    ggplot2::labs(
        x = "Risk score",
        y = "Pathway score"
    ) +
    ggplot2::theme_bw(base_size = 20) +
    change_plot_aes_point()
```

@fig-cor-risk-pathways shows that in general the signatures are not 
strongly associated with one of the main pathways displayed here.
On the other hand, @fig-cor-riskpcs-pathways shows the association between
the signatures and the risk scores derived only from the principal components.

```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=10}
#| label: fig-cor-riskpcs-pathways

endo_only_sm %>%
    tidyr::pivot_longer(
        cols = names(pathways_of_interest),
        names_to = "pathway",
        values_to = "score"
    ) %>%
    ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = risk_score_pcs, y = score)) +

    ggplot2::theme_bw(base_size = 20) +
    change_plot_aes_point()
```

In this case we see some associations with G2M checkpoint in general and a bit
with estrogen signaling. We now calculate the correlation plots 
for each one of these pathways with both risk scores. 

```{r}
corr_values <- cor(endo_only_sm[
    , 
    c("risk_score", "risk_score_pcs", names(pathways_of_interest))
], method = "spearman") 
names_corr <- c(
    "RS", "RS_PC", 
    pathways_of_interest[rownames(corr_values)[3:nrow(corr_values)]]
)
rownames(corr_values) <- names_corr
colnames(corr_values) <- names_corr
```

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
#| label: fig-corr-risk-pathways
#| fig-cap: Correlation matrix for all pathways of interest and the two 
#|     risk scores, both including the clinical factors and without the 
#|     clinical factors.
ggcorrplot::ggcorrplot(
    corr_values,
    hc.order = TRUE, 
    type = "lower",
    lab = TRUE, 
    lab_size = 6, 
    ggtheme = ggplot2::theme_bw(base_size = 15), 
    tl.cex = 20
) + 
    change_plot_aes_point() + 
    ggplot2::labs(x = "", y = "")
```

@fig-corr-risk-pathways shows that G2M checkpoint is highly correlated
with the risk score using only the principal components ($\rho = 0.72$). 
When you include the clinical factors this value decreases. Moreover,
DNA repair is highly associated with RS PC. Estrogen signaling was not 
so important here in the signatures surprisingly. 

If we subselect only the SCANB samples we can recalculate those values
and compare with the NCN ROR score. 

```{r}
corr_values <- cor(
    endo_only_scanb %>% 
        dplyr::select(dplyr::all_of(c(
            "risk_score", "risk_score_pcs", "NCN.ROR.asT0",
            names(pathways_of_interest)
        ))), 
    method = "spearman"
) 
names_corr <- c(
    "RS", "RS PC", "NCN ROR",
    pathways_of_interest[rownames(corr_values)[4:nrow(corr_values)]]
)
rownames(corr_values) <- names_corr
colnames(corr_values) <- names_corr
```

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
#| label: fig-corr-risk-pathways-scanb
#| fig-cap: Correlation matrix for all pathways of interest and the two 
#|     risk scores, both including the clinical factors and without the 
#|     clinical factors.
ggcorrplot::ggcorrplot(
    corr_values,
    hc.order = TRUE, 
    type = "lower",
    lab = TRUE, 
    lab_size = 6, 
    ggtheme = ggplot2::theme_bw(base_size = 15), 
    tl.cex = 20
) + 
    change_plot_aes_point() + 
    ggplot2::labs(x = "", y = "")
```
