  abstract  = "Most textbooks on regression focus on theory and the simplest of
               examples. Real statistical problems, however, are complex and
               subtle. This is not a book about the theory of regression. It is
               about using regression to solve real problems of comparison,
               estimation, prediction, and causal inference. Unlike other
               books, it focuses on practical issues such as sample size and
               missing data and a wide range of goals and techniques. It jumps
               right in to methods and computer code you can use immediately.
               Real examples, real stories from the authors' experience
               demonstrate what regression can do and its limitations, with
               practical advice for understanding assumptions and implementing
               methods for experiments and observational studies. They make a
               smooth transition to logistic regression and GLM. The emphasis
               is on computation in R and Stan rather than derivations, with
               code available online. Graphics and presentation aid
               understanding of the models and model fitting.",
