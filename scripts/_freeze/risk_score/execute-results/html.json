Some examples were given in the previous chapters, such as \nOncotypeDX, Prosigna and EndoPredict. They were all derived in a similar\nmanner, subsetting genes related to usually estrogen and proliferation \nsignaling and then using recurrence free survival data to calculate\nthe risk scores. \n\nIn this chapter we introduce a new risk score that does not subset\ngenes and uses the information of the molecular landscape. The concept\nis simple, we will use the third and fourth components as covariates in\nthe survival modeling along with tumor size and node status. This\nway we avoid subsetting and selecting specific genes and we use all\nthe information the molecular landscape is providing us. Also it avoids\nany kind of binning for patients based on molecular subtype, thus not being\nnecessary calculating correlations with pre-defined molecular subtypes.\n\nLater in the chapter we compare the risk score with the ROR binary \ncategories: high and low/intermediate risk. We also compare the risk score\nwith the ROR continuous value obtained by the SCANB team using nearest\ncentroid classification (NCN). We use samples from patients that were treated\nwith endocrine therapy only for the training of the risk score. Even though \nthe ROR was trained on a cohort of patients that received no treatment, we \ncan still compare the signatures. @Buus2021 showed that the EndoPredict \nsignature is highly correlated to ROR ($\\rho = 0.68$), therefore we can \nto some extent take conclusions based on the ROR signature.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n* The library is already synchronized with the lockfile.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe develop a risk score for early stage breast cancer patients that \nreceived only endocrine therapy (ET). The idea is similar to what was\ndone with the EndoPredict signatures, but here we extend it by using the\nmolecular landscape information. This provides a full framework where\nwe can analyse the risk of recurrence even for patients that have \nhigh ER+ percentage.\n\n## Generating the risk score\n\nWe focus only on the endocrine treated patients. For the training part\nof the algorithm we use a subset of patients from the METABRIC cohort.\nWe then test the risk scores in the test set and we further validate\nthe score on SCANB. \n\nWe will generate two risk scores: one including only the principal \ncomponents and another one including the clinical features of the \npatients when valiable, namely tumor size, node status and age (either having\none or more lymph node with breast cancer cells or none). \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nCall:\nsurvival::coxph(formula = as.formula(paste0(\"Surv(time = rfs_months, event = rfs_status) ~ \", \n    paste(c(pcs_to_use, clin_vars), collapse = \"+\"))), data = training_set)\n\n  n= 556, number of events= 216 \n\n                    coef exp(coef)  se(coef)      z Pr(>|z|)    \nPC3            -0.091540  0.912525  0.027255 -3.359 0.000783 ***\nPC4             0.080512  1.083842  0.022588  3.564 0.000365 ***\ntumor_size      0.021809  1.022049  0.004292  5.082 3.74e-07 ***\nnode_statuspos  0.582681  1.790834  0.147602  3.948 7.89e-05 ***\nage             0.003150  1.003155  0.007030  0.448 0.654061    \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n               exp(coef) exp(-coef) lower .95 upper .95\nPC3               0.9125     1.0959    0.8651    0.9626\nPC4               1.0838     0.9226    1.0369    1.1329\ntumor_size        1.0220     0.9784    1.0135    1.0307\nnode_statuspos    1.7908     0.5584    1.3410    2.3916\nage               1.0032     0.9969    0.9894    1.0171\n\nConcordance= 0.676  (se = 0.019 )\nLikelihood ratio test= 66.18  on 5 df,   p=6e-13\nWald test            = 71.92  on 5 df,   p=4e-14\nScore (logrank) test = 72.75  on 5 df,   p=3e-14\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see that all coefficients have less variability than age. \nNow we calculate only the risk score based on the components. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nCall:\nsurvival::coxph(formula = as.formula(paste0(\"Surv(time = rfs_months, event = rfs_status) ~ \", \n    paste(c(pcs_to_use), collapse = \"+\"))), data = training_set)\n\n  n= 556, number of events= 216 \n\n        coef exp(coef) se(coef)      z Pr(>|z|)    \nPC3 -0.08657   0.91707  0.02699 -3.207  0.00134 ** \nPC4  0.09068   1.09492  0.02216  4.091 4.29e-05 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n    exp(coef) exp(-coef) lower .95 upper .95\nPC3    0.9171     1.0904    0.8698    0.9669\nPC4    1.0949     0.9133    1.0484    1.1435\n\nConcordance= 0.626  (se = 0.019 )\nLikelihood ratio test= 22.5  on 2 df,   p=1e-05\nWald test            = 22.49  on 2 df,   p=1e-05\nScore (logrank) test = 22.78  on 2 df,   p=1e-05\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see that the coefficients are very similar to what was found before,\nit didn't change much.

The slope\nfor the non responders is parallel to the identity line going through\nthe origin with a slope of 1, meaning that there is not much change of risk\nupon the treatment. On other hand, for the responder group the slope is\ndecreased and has a value lower than 1, meaning that the risk is decreased\nupon aromatase inhibition after two weeks (@fig-poetic-risk-base-surgery).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Comparison of risk scores using the PCs only before and after two weeks of aromatase inhibitors in post-menopausal women.

Also some\nof the basal samples have smaller ROR than some of the luminal\nB and A samples, and the risk score captures these differences, i.e.,\nall basal samples have risk scores higher than 0.75.\n",
