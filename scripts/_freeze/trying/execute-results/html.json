We\nthen calculate the scores for each cohort separately and then compare\nto what was calculated before. We can then try to calculate the scores\nusing samples coming from all cohorts.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn general it looks good, the luminal B population is a bit compressed \ntowards the luminal A population though.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere is a very good merging of the datasets. We see mostly\ngreen points because they are the majority. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow we see that the first loadings has a tail in a similar fashio as the\nother loadings. \n\nWe now try to calculate the scores of the samples using these new embeddings\nonly from TCGA samples as we will compare the results later on. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nAnd we can now check and compare the scores.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see that for the three pathways the correlation is positive and\nstrong. The difference is that it is a bit noisy, so the correlation\nis not perfect. What is interesting to see is that at the extremes\nthe scores have less variation usually. \n\nWe now calculate the scores from SCANB and compare the results. Remember\nthat SCANB was not used for the PCA training.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nAnd we can now check and compare the scores.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe same phenomenon happened. Samples in the endges have lower variability,\nbut samples in the middle are the ones that have high variability.\nFor example there are several samples from the regressed data\nwith SET_ERPR score close to 0.25 and negative scores.\n\nWhat happens now if we use another dataset and then use only one sample to \ncalculate the score. Let us include SCANB samples in the pipeline. For this \nwe select 50 scanb samples and 100 random samples from tcga and metabric.\nWe then combine all these samples together and calculate the GSVA scores.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nWe now plot only the scores from the SCANB samples.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo it seems there are still dataset related problems there when calculating\nthe scores. The scores are positively correlated, but they are not quite\nthe same as only using the SCANB dataset. Moreover, for G2M checkpoint the \nscores are concentrated around -0.4 from the regressed data but \nthey are in a range going from - 0.4 to 0.1 in the unregressed data. \n\nIf we try to instead add some samples from the SCANB dataset as well \nrandomly into the mix. How well does the scores get compared to the \n\"ground truth\"? \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt does not work so well when including some SCANB samples together \nwith the METABRIC and TCGA samples. We are trying to achieve a\ncorrelation of almost 1 with very low variability since we want to use\nthe scores clinically. \n\nLet us check the distribution of some genes for SCANB and TCGA after\nregressing out the first two PCs.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see that even though the expression profile of the samples are \noverlapping there are discrepancies. That is why when using GSVA \nit does not work so well perhaps.\n\n## Scoring strategy with regressed data\n\nWe now try to use a slightly different scoring strategy. We can think of \nour data in a log scale, so what we do now instead is to sum all of \nour genes of interest and then subtract an average of the housekeeping\ngenes expression levels.\n\nFirst we check the distribution of this average for each cohort\nseparately.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of the average of the housekeeping genes for distinct cohorts.](trying_files/figure-html/fig-hkg-regressed-1.png){#fig-hkg-regressed width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIndeed the tcga and metabric cohorts have an overlapping \ndistribution, but the SCANB does not overlap completely, it is\nactually shifted. One should still take into account that \nthe distributions are very close to 0, meaning that the \nhousekeeping genes have very close to 0 values, as expected here in this case.\nWe now calculate the score by taking this into account. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scores obtained from regressed data of all the four cohorts TCGA, SCANB, METABRIC and POETIC compared to the original GSVA scores.](trying_files/figure-html/fig-scores-regressed-1.png){#fig-scores-regressed width=1344}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe scores are actually highly correlated, specially the estrogen related \npathways. Also the correlation between the scores in general follows the \nsame trends.\n\nThe plot below is a subset of the scores above to include in the \npublication.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scores obtained from regressed data of all the four cohorts TCGA, SCANB, METABRIC and POETIC compared to the original GSVA scores.](trying_files/figure-html/fig-scores-regressed-subset-1.png){#fig-scores-regressed-subset width=1632}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe now compare the distributions\nof these scores across the different cohorts and pathways of interest.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png){width=1536}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd with all molecular subtypes together.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see that the overlap is actually pretty good in general, even for \nSCANB. The only part where there is a bigger discrepancy is for\nG2M checkpoint. We see below that by calculating the GSVA score \non the whole scanb cohort we don't have this problem.\n\nAnd as a comparison we plot with the original scores using GSVA on the \nwhole cohort individually.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png){width=1536}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd all the subtypes together for the original score:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-37-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see that by doing GSVA the distributions they overlap much more than \nusing the regressed data and the simple sum of the values for those genes.\nStill for estrogen signaling it seems that the estrogen early signature\nis pretty robust.\n\n### Checking the patients from POETIC with new scores\n\nWe now use the new scores to evaluate the comparison with the neighboorhood,\njust as before in the previous chapter where we used the POETIC trial data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nPatient 63 @fig-pt63 is considered a responder. According to \nthe scores, when comparing the estrogen early signature to its average \ndistribution in the neighborhood, the score is higher.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Posterior distribution of the average scores in the neighborhood of patient 63 from POETIC trial.

According to \nthe scores, when comparing the estrogen early signature to its average \ndistribution in the neighborhood, the score is lower, being in the\n5% quantile.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Posterior distribution of the average scores in the neighborhood of patient 236 from POETIC trial. Each dot corresponds to a 1% quantile.](trying_files/figure-html/fig-pt236-1.png){#fig-pt236 width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhen comparing these two patients, there is also a difference in the androgen\nresponse score, which could be a reflection of different estrogen signaling.\n\nIt reflects what we saw previously as well. \n\n### Responder vs non responder comparison of new scores\n\nWe now compare the scores for responders and non responders.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-41-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe higher E2F targets in average the lower the estrogen early score is\nfor non responders, whereas this correlation does not exist for responder\npatients. This difference is mostly drive by the high E2F target non responder\ntumors. \n\nNow the plot below shows the correlation for baselien Ki67% and E2F targets\nfor the score calculated in the regressed data in a single sample manner. \nWe see a positive correlation between the two scores. Moreover, it is interesting\nto see that when the tumor has low Ki67, there is still a spectrum on \nthe E2F targets score. Also there is no difference in the correlation \nbetween responders and non responders.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-42-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd lastly we compare the estrogen signaling signatures between\nresponders and non-responder.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-43-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see that the estrogen response early has a wider range when compared to the\nSET ER/PR score. That makes sense as this signature has over 100 genes,\nwhereas SET ER/PR has only 18. Also the responder\nwas very good in discriminating the responders and non responders.\nWhat we can conclude from this figure is that the samples\nwith very low scores are usually non responders, which reflect\ntheir position in the molecular landscape, also in general \nresponders have higher ER signaling than non responders.\n\nBelow is the figure with the GSVA scores before regressing the data, \nwe see that SET ER/PR is not able to really distinguish \ncompletely the non-responders with very low score similar\nto what was done with GSVA. Even estrogen early had\nsome differences.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-44-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd below is a figure with both GSVA and regressed scores together.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Comparing scoring strategies for responders and non responders in the POETIC dataset.](trying_files/figure-html/fig-comparison-scoring-strategy-poetic-1.png){#fig-comparison-scoring-strategy-poetic width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nBelow we show the correlation between\nthese scores for all cohorts.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-46-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese scores are highly correlated but in different absolute\nscales. We now check the change in Ki67 for all patients and \ncompare the scores with the original ones obtained with GSVA.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Comparison of original GSVA and regressed scores between responders and non responders compared to change in Ki67.](trying_files/figure-html/fig-comparison-og-regressed-er-1.png){#fig-comparison-og-regressed-er width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see that the bigger the change the higher the score is when using the\nregressed data. Also the non responders tend to have scores mostly in\nthe negative scale, whereas the responders are more shifted to the\nright. SET ER/PR is also a good measure here. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-48-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere is a very good match between the two scores in general,\nmeaning that the regression scoring strategy capture relatively\nwell the scores. There is one patient that is a non-responder\nand has a low regressed estrogen early but a GSVA score \nclose to 0, let us check this patient.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item-overflow-hidden html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-ec3f14c1088af128cafe\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-ec3f14c1088af128cafe\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"vertical\":false,\"data\":[[\"1\"],[\"80\"],[43.24122479462285],[-5.649422739144427],[26.83238127635096],[\"pos\"]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th> <\\/th>\\n      <th>patient_nb<\\/th>\\n      <th>ki67<\\/th>\\n      <th>PC3<\\/th>\\n      <th>change_ki67<\\/th>\\n      <th>er_status<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"columnDefs\":[{\"className\":\"dt-right\",\"targets\":[2,3,4]},{\"orderable\":false,\"targets\":0}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false},\"selection\":{\"mode\":\"multiple\",\"selected\":null,\"target\":\"row\",\"selectable\":null}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt is a patient that is far to the left on the molecular landscape, among the\nbasal like, and had an increase in Ki67 upon ET.

Though the\nscaled scores they have comparable hazard ratios and also \nthey follow what we saw previously. The only pathway that is \na bit different is the PI3K AKT MTOR signaling. This pathway had a noisier\ncorrelation with the GSVA score as well.\n\n## Regressing the PDXs\n\nWe can use the regressing strategy to score the PDXs and then evaluate\ntheir scores. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nWe start by comparing the scores across the different \ncontrol samples and their positions in the molecular landscape.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Embedding of only regressed PDX control samples on top of the METABRIC, SCANB and TCGA samples](trying_files/figure-html/fig-pca-pdx-control-only-regressed-1.png){#fig-pca-pdx-control-only-regressed width=864}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe results are jus twhat we got previously as well, meaning that\nby using all these genes the information of the PDXs are still \ncaptured. The main differences is that the luminal B region is more\ncompact compare to @fig-pca-pdx-control-only.\n\nAnd now that we have the results we can compare the PDXs as well. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scores obtained from the regressed data of the PDXs.](trying_files/figure-html/fig-pdx-regressed-scores-1.png){#fig-pdx-regressed-scores width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe random 200 is just a gene set with 200 random genes that works as a \ncontrol and serves as a comparison to the other pathways.\n\nAnd below we show the distribution of some of the scores calculated \nfor all the other cohorts as a comparison. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-56-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see that METS15 is the one with the highest proliferation and\nlowest EMT, it is a PDX that comes from a pleural efusion. Also\nit is the PDX with the lowest apoptosis and highest DNA repair,\nprobably due to a higher replication rate. Moreover, all these\nPDXs they have a estrogen response early scores higher than 0\nin average, which is about the average of the scores in the\nER+ BC samples.\n\nNow we check what happens with some of the PDXs when they\nare treated with P4, to compare with @fig-pdx-p4-control-pathways.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Comparison of position in the molecular landscape between CTRL, E2 and P4 treated samples with the regressed data](trying_files/figure-html/fig-pdx-p4-control-pathways-regressed.-1.png){#fig-pdx-p4-control-pathways-regressed. width=1248}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe results are very similar to what was seen previously using the GSVA. What is \ninteresting here is that we have an absolute scale, so we can compare the scores.\n\n## singscore\n\nWe can try to use singscore instead, it is a sample dependent measure so \nit does not estimate the distribution of the gene expression levels before\ncalculating the enrichment score.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nWe start by comparing with the GSVA scores.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-59-1.png){width=1920}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see that in all cases there is a correlation, but the interpretation\nchanges. In some of the pathways there is difference in the singscores\nbased on the cohort, this is not seen on GSVA. \n\nThe next two figures are the distributions of the singscore and GSVA\nfilled by cohort.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-60-1.png){width=1920}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor several pathways in the singscore the distributions are similar,\nbut that is not always the case.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-61-1.png){width=1920}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOn the other hand GSVA gives very similar distributions for all the \ndifferent cohorts. Therefore we actually need to use GSVA. It is important in \nthe end to calculate scores based on the cohort. \n\nWe now move on and try the same analysis on the regressed data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nWe start by comparing with the GSVA scores.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-63-1.png){width=1920}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see that in all cases there is a correlation, but the interpretation\nchanges.

For example the\nhallmark estrogen response early and set ER/PR pathways seem to \nhave been regressed quite well, so we can actually compare the results using \nthe scores. On the other hand we can't use the pathways G2M checkpoint,\nE2F targets and EMT. For the PI3K signaling score it seems it is \ncomparable to SCANB only.\n\n## Using several pathways or just one pathway for GSVA\n\nWe now evaluate the effect of the scores for each pathway when using all the\n53 pathways combined and each one individually. We use only TCGA for \nthis step.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### One vs all\n\nWe now calculate the scores for each gene set individually.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-68-1.png){width=1920}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt seems they are all positively correlated, so one could calculate the \nscores basically using just one gene set with exception of some of the\ngene sets. \n\n## Minimum number of samples for GSVA\n\nAccording to the original GSVA paper, a minimum of 10 samples are necessary\nto have a good power when using GSVA. Since here we have at least 5 \nmolecular subgroups, we hypothesize we need at least 50 samples to get a \ngood score so we can compare across cohorts. We will try with\ndifferent numbers of samples using TCGA, we start with 10, 25, 50 and\n100 samples and we compare with the scores using the full dataset.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-72-1.png){width=4800}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-73-1.png){width=4800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe conclusion we can take here is that depending on the gene set not even 150\nsamples is enough. For some only 25 patients is already enough, such as SET \nER/PR, androgen response, estrogen response early and E2F targets.\n\nCould we mix around 20 samples of SCANB together with more samples from \nTCGA and METABRIC to get the scores?

We will compare some of the signatures\nby using GSVA on the original datasets and by calculating the sum of the\ngene expression levels of the genes when regressing out the 1st, 2nd and\n5th components.\n\nThe table below shows the number of genes available for each signature\nand each dataset. In general it seems that all signatures have over\n70% of the genes available, a good indication.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\" lightable-classic\"

The thing is, \nproliferation related genes are pretty much present in almost any signature\nand hence all these pathways are correlated to G2M and E2F to some extent \n[@Venet2011].\n\nHere we calculate the pathway scores by using the regressed data and do\nall pairwise comparison of some of the most important pathways to see\ntheir correlations.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-120-1.png){width=1632}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFirst we see that G2M and E2F are encoding basically the same information. \nPI3K AKT MTOR, AR and the Biocarta HER2 and SET ER/PR are all correlated to\nsome extent to proliferation. Surprisingly the two HER2 signaling scores \nare not able to distinguish the HER2 subtype.\nThe SET ER/PR correlation with G2M is possibly explained by the fact that\nthe basal molecular subtype has higher G2M and lower ER signaling compared to\nluminal A and B.\n\n## HER2 and their categories\n\nResearch on the benefits of giving trastuzumab together with antibody drug\nconjugates (ADCs) has been\nshown recently. Patients that are either HER2+ or even considered negative\nbut have some expression of HER2 (1+ and 2+) seem to benefit from ADC + \ntrastuzumab. \n\nHere we first see what are the genes that are leading the differences \nof the HER2 molecular subtype. We query 7 genes that are available in the \nlist of 8+ regions and are in the amplicon region of ERBB2 when this gene\nis amplified (HER2+). \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-121-1.png){width=1728}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFirst we notice that ERBB2 is actually not the gene that is driving the \ndifferences, perhaps because when the embedding was learned during the PCA\nthis gene was not used to make the differences between the molecular subtype.\nInstead, the genes that are mostly capturing the difference of the \nHER2-enriched PAM50 molecular subtype are FBXL20, GRB7, MED1 and STARD3. \n\nAnd if we check by HER2 status according to the available datasets.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Regressed gene expression levels and comparison between the HER2 groups.](trying_files/figure-html/fig-her2-genes-1.png){#fig-her2-genes width=1536}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSimilar to what was seen before for ER status you see differences for\nthe HER2+ patients. Note that several of the patients that have gain of\nHER2 have similar gene expression levels to those that have loss\nor are neutral. Moreover, the top genes that are differentiating the \nHER2 status are STARD3, GRB7 and MED1. The differences in HER2 \nare actually very small, but it looks like there is a consistent difference\nstill.\n\nJust before we move on we compare the expression levels before and\nafter regressing the data on SCANB to see if we are not messing\nup too much with the gene expression levels and getting just noise. \n\nThe plot below shows the correlation between ERBB2 FPKM and regressed\ndata and also for GRB7. We further show the correlation between\nGRB7 and ERBB2 in the regressed data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-123-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see a good correlation between FPKM and regressed data. Moreover there is a good\ncorrelation between GRB7 and HER2 in both regressed data and FPKM. We now\ndefine a new score based on these genes available. The score is calculated\nin the same way as before the regressed data, i.e., the sum of the \nexpression levels.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![HER2 AMPLICON signature stratified by the HER2 status](trying_files/figure-html/fig-her2-amplicon-her2subgroups-1.png){#fig-her2-amplicon-her2subgroups width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd now plotting for the molecular subtypes specifically.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![HER2 AMPLICON signature stratified by the PAM50 molecular subtypes](trying_files/figure-html/fig-pam50-her2-amplicon-1.png){#fig-pam50-her2-amplicon width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is a signature that captures better the HER2 molecular subtype, but not in\nits entirety. \n\nSimilar to what we did previously,\nwe check if this signature is correlated with proliferation. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-126-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf there is any correlation it is too small and not clear.
