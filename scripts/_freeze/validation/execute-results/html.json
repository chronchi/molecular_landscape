To completely validate, we use another\nbig cohort, SCANB, that was not used in the PCA fitting and testing before.\nThis way we ensure that the embedding is independent of the cohort. Moreover,\nwe use the SMC cohort [@Kan2018], whose patients are from South Korea.\nWe show how well it is embedded, and that \nis not dependent on population characteristics. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n* The library is already synchronized with the lockfile.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## SCANB embedding\n\nThe embedding was already calculate before when calculating the fit and\ntests, since the datasets were organized and loaded together. We also\nknow already that all the 1044 genes are available in the SCANB cohort. \nSCANB is well mixed with all cohorts as @fig-pca-scanb shows.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![PCA embedding colored by cohort.

Moreover, if there isn't, the cohort should be closer\nto TCGA than to METABRIC, due to technologies and normalization procedures,\nas both of them are log FPKM. Even though SCANB was processed in a way \nto get directly FPKM values, by using cufflinks, TCGA was normalized to get\nlog FPKM as well, as discussed previously. @fig-pca-scanb-pc1 shows\nhow close SCANB is from TCGA, moreover there is already some overlap. The \nvariability in the first component is bigger for METABRIC compared to\nTCGA and SCANB. Probably this is due to the technology processing, since\nthey have genes in the same scale. @fig-pca-no-norm contrasts the different\nnormalization procedures. If genes are not scaled correctly, the PCA\nshows an inverse picture.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![PCA embedding colored by cohort.

Usually this is\ndue to processing pipelines or even data quality, therefore genes are removed.\nThis should not be much of a problem, if the data is good enough, when \ncalculating the qPCR-like normalization as it was shown before. The problem\narises when multiplying the loadings obtained in the PCA with the \nnormalized expression of the sample. If several genes are missing, 0s are \nadded to the matrix and therefore the loadings for these genes cannot be \nused. Since 1000 genes were used, we investigate the loadings of genes and \ntry to calculate a fuzziness score, indicating when the embedding should\nbe trusted if genes are missing, and which genes are missing. \n\n### Fuzziness score \n\nThe idea of the fuzziness score is that we use the loadings of the missing\ngenes and calculate the cumulative sum of their absolute values. \nThe higher this value\nthe more it indicates the missing genes are important. We start by\nremoving random genes from random samples of the SCANB cohort. Each sample\nwill have a random number of genes removed from the set of 1044 genes. \nThen two scores are calculated, one for PC3 and another for PC4. We also\ncalculate the fuzziness score for the top loading genes and the \nlow loadings genes, to compare these values.\n\nWe start by comparing the scores from top loadings and low loading genes. For\nthis we remove the top 50 loadings and bottom 50 loadings, in terms of\nabsolute values. @fig-loadings-top-bottom shows the cumulative sum\nof the absolute values from the top and bottom loadings respectively. See how \nimportant the top loadings are compared to the bottom loadings. A way of\nthinking of this is that the top loadings weights are much more important\nwhen calculating the embedding.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Cumulative sum of absolute values for the top loadings and bottom loadings as a function of the number of selected genes.](validation_files/figure-html/fig-loadings-top-bottom-1.png){#fig-loadings-top-bottom width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis was using the top loadings, so probably the fuzziness score of a sample\nwith relatively good data will be between 0 and 12 maximum, meaning that\nthey have less than 200 genes missing. When genes are missing, we hope that\nthey are in the bottom part of the loadings, so the fuzziness score\nis as small as possible. \n\nSuppose now that the genes missing in a sample are random. We will calculate\nrandom fuzziness scores based on this to have a feeling of the scores. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of the fuzziness scores from random missing genes. Each color corresponds to a different distribution using a different number of genes.](validation_files/figure-html/fig-fuzziness-random-1.png){#fig-fuzziness-random width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-fuzziness-random shows the results as a function of the number of missing\ngenes. We see that in average, if 200 genes are missing, the fuzziness\nscore is around 5. If less than a 100 genes are missing, the fuzziness\nscore is around 3. In the next section we show how this influences the\nposition where the sample is projected into the embedding.\n\nFinally, we calculate the fuzziness score as a number of top loadings \nmissing. Suppose 150 genes are missing. We will change the proportion\nof genes that are in the top loadings and in the missing list. Since\nthe cumulative sum for PC2 and PC3 are very similar, we focus only on\nPC2.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of the fuzziness scores from 150 random missing genes with different proportions of top loading genes in the list. Each color corresponds to a different distribution using a different proportion of genes.](validation_files/figure-html/fig-fuzziness-random-top-1.png){#fig-fuzziness-random-top width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-fuzziness-random-top shows the fuzziness score with different proportions\nof the top loading genes. We see that they are actually very important when\ncalculating the score. The top loading genes were defined as the top 150 genes\nin the list. So when calculating the number of missing genes it is important\nto check the number of top loadings in the list. \n\n### Validating the score\n\nIn this section we calculate the embeddings with different number of genes\nmissing from a given sample and then plot the original embedding with\nthe newly one. For this\nwe use samples from TCGA. The genes are \nremoved even before the normalization procedure, as they are usually not\navailable there. We select randomly a number of top genes from PC3 and PC4\nto compose the list of missing genes. The proportion of the top loading\ngenes is varied. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### TCGA-OL-A66K-01A-11R-A29R-07\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](validation_files/figure-html/fig-missing-correction-10-1.png){#fig-missing-correction-10 width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### TCGA-GI-A2C9-01A-11R-A21T-07\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](validation_files/figure-html/fig-missing-correction-20-1.png){#fig-missing-correction-20 width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### TCGA-3C-AALK-01A-11R-A41B-07\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](validation_files/figure-html/fig-missing-correction-50-1.png){#fig-missing-correction-50 width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### TCGA-BH-A0BW-01A-11R-A115-07\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](validation_files/figure-html/fig-missing-correction-80-1.png){#fig-missing-correction-80 width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### TCGA-A1-A0SI-01A-11R-A144-07\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](validation_files/figure-html/fig-missing-correction-182-1.png){#fig-missing-correction-182 width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### TCGA-D8-A27L-01A-11R-A16F-07\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](validation_files/figure-html/fig-missing-correction-198-1.png){#fig-missing-correction-198 width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nWhen looking at the figures above, it seems that whenever there are \ngenes missing,\nand the more of top loadings they are, the closer they are to the origin.\nThis makes sense, since PCA is doing a simple linear combination of the loadings.\nThis should be fine to correct, since we can fit a line going through the \norigin and goes through the points above. Then the adjustment will depend\non the number of genes that are missing and are top loadings. The more \nthey are, the more adjustment we will need. \n\nFor the adjustment we only know two things, its current position and \nhow many of the top loadings are missing. Based on this information we\nshould be able to correct the samples. Given the list of genes that are missing,\nwe fit lines that would go through the genes that are missing in the TCGA\nand METABRIC samples. We then try to find the line that is closes to the point.\nAfter performing the fit and the line, we can then move the point to closer\nto the METABRIC and TCGA samples. The point should be close to the line\nand close to points that have the same proportion of top loadings \nmissing.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThese plots show how the fuzziness score might be indicative of how\ngood the embedding will be depending on the number of missing genes. The\nvideo below shows the images for 20 different patients.

The idea is that we extract\nsome metrics from the TCGA samples as we increase the amount of the most\nimportant genes removed from the sample. What we simply do is \nfor each patient we calculate the distance of the new embedding to the\noriginal embedding. Since for each proportion we ran the analysis 10 times \nwe get 10 distances. We average over those. In the end we have \n20 \"distances\" for each one of the 200 TCGA samples.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n@fig-proportion-missing-genes-distance shows the relationship between\nthe proportion of missing top loading genes among the 200 genes that\nwere selected out and the average distance to the original embedding. Each\ndot corresponds to the a sample. In total there are 200 dots in each\nproportion.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Average distance to the original embedding](validation_files/figure-html/fig-proportion-missing-genes-distance-1.png){#fig-proportion-missing-genes-distance width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see that the more top loading genes that are\nmissing the worse the embedding gets. Still the average distance is \na bit difficult to interpret, so next we show the relationship between \nthe variance and the proportion of missing genes. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](validation_files/figure-html/fig-var-proportion-missing-genes-1.png){#fig-var-proportion-missing-genes width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIndeed as the proportion of the most important genes goes missing, there is\na higher variance in the average distance.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nNext we evaluate the number of samples in the neighborhood of samples, so\nwe can understand a bit better what is distance in the molecular embedder. \n\n@fig-nb-samples-avg-neighborhood shows the proportion of samples in a \nneighborhood based on its radius. For samples within a radius of 1, in average\nthe percentage of samples from the whole dataset including TCGA and METABRIC\nis of 2.5%.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Percentage of number of samples in the neighborhood with varyiing radii.

The samples seem to be well mixed already in\nthe RNA-seq samples. This is probably due to the fact that the SMC cohort\nhas TPM values. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nWhen checking the total number of genes missing, there are only \n4 genes missing. \nAnd as seen before, this number is almost irrelevant, in the sense that\nthe embedding will still be robust and locations will be precise enough.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Biplot of first two PCA components from SMC, TCGA, SCANB and METABRIC.

Based on that they can\nstablish themselves and proliferate. The environment should recapitulate\nwhat is seen in women as well, in the sense that estrogen (E2) levels \nare similar to those of post-menopausal women. Since these cells have\nto proliferate in order to establish and grow in the ducts, we expect\nthem to be more proliferative in terms of RNA-seq components and also\nto lie in the luminal B region of the molecular landscape.

For this we select only samples\nwith PC3 higher than 0, as these would be the ones that are from\nluminal A and B subtypes and we use PC3 as a score in the survival analysis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\" lightable-classic\" style='font-family: \"Arial Narrow\", \"Source Sans Pro\", sans-serif; width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;'>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> cohort </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> number_patients </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> nb_events </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> SCANB </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2777 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 456 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> METABRIC </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 724 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 445 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> SCANB High ER </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2253 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 347 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFirst we check the correlation of PC3 with estrogen response early and \nG2M checkpoint.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](validation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-55-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere is indeed the correlation with the components but still a lot of \nvariability.

see that in all cases the HR for PC3 is below 1, for OS the values are\n0.98 and 0.97 and the HR and for RFS from 0.80 to 0.93. What is \ninteresting to note here is that in all cases the confidence interval\nis crossing 1, as expected due to the variability of the \ncorrelation with SET ER/PR and estrogen response early. \nRemember that the hazard ratio scale is not\nlinear. Indeed it seems that the more a sample is on the right side\nof the plot the better is its outcome. Notice that the \nscale for HR is different for PC3 and SET ER/PR, since one is a positive\nscore ranging from 0 to 8 and the other is a score ranging from\n-1 to 1. If we were to rescale SET ER/PR to an interval between\n0 to 10 by multiplying by 5 and then summing 5, we would get \nhazard ratios in the range of 0.8. Moreover, estrogen signaling\nis not the only thing fully explaining the third component as\nit can be seen from @fig-pca-mol-land-pathways. In this case,\nG2M Checkpoint and PI3K signaling have also a role in the third\ncomponent.\n\nThe following figures correspond to the overall survival analysis and\nrecurrence free survival analysis from the SCANB and METABRIC.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](validation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-59-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](validation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-60-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Overall and recurrence free survival analysis of the principal components PC3 and PC4.
