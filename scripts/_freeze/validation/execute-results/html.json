To completely validate, we use another\nbig cohort, SCANB, that was not used in the PCA fitting and testing before.\nThis way we ensure that the embedding is independent of the cohort. Moreover,\nwe use the SMC cohort [@Kan2018], whose patients are from South Korea.\nWe show how well it is embedded, and that \nis not dependent on population characteristics. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## SCANB embedding\n\nThe embedding was already calculate before when calculating the fit and\ntests, since the datasets were organized and loaded together. We also\nknow already that all the 1044 genes are available in the SCANB cohort. \nSCANB is well mixed with all cohorts as @fig-pca-scanb shows.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![PCA embedding colored by cohort.

Moreover, if there isn't, the cohort should be closer\nto TCGA than to METABRIC, due to technologies and normalization procedures,\nas both of them are log FPKM. Even though SCANB was processed in a way \nto get directly FPKM values, by using cufflinks, TCGA was normalized to get\nlog FPKM as well, as discussed previously. @fig-pca-scanb-pc1 shows\nhow close SCANB is from TCGA, moreover there is already some overlap. The \nvariability in the first component is bigger for METABRIC compared to\nTCGA and SCANB. Probably this is due to the technology processing, since\nthey have genes in the same scale. @fig-pca-no-norm contrasts the different\nnormalization procedures. If genes are not scaled correctly, the PCA\nshows an inverse picture.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![PCA embedding colored by cohort.

Usually this is\ndue to processing pipelines or even data quality, therefore genes are removed.\nThis should not be much of a problem, if the data is good enough, when \ncalculating the qPCR-like normalization as it was shown before. The problem\narises when multiplying the loadings obtained in the PCA with the \nnormalized expression of the sample. If several genes are missing, 0s are \nadded to the matrix and therefore the loadings for these genes cannot be \nused. Since 1000 genes were used, we investigate the loadings of genes and \ntry to calculate a fuzziness score, indicating when the embedding should\nbe trusted if genes are missing, and which genes are missing. \n\n### Fuzziness score \n\nThe idea of the fuzziness score is that we use the loadings of the missing\ngenes and calculate the cumulative sum of their absolute values. \nThe higher this value\nthe more it indicates the missing genes are important. We start by\nremoving random genes from random samples of the SCANB cohort. Each sample\nwill have a random number of genes removed from the set of 1044 genes. \nThen two scores are calculated, one for PC2 and another for PC3. We also\ncalculate the fuzziness score for the top loading genes and the \nlow loadings genes, to compare these values.\n\nWe start by comparing the scores from top loadings and low loading genes. For\nthis we remove the top 50 loadings and bottom 50 loadings, in terms of\nabsolute values. @fig-loadings-top-bottom shows the cumulative sum\nof the absolute values from the top and bottom loadings respectively. See how \nimportant the top loadings are compared to the bottom loadings. A way of\nthinking of this is that the top loadings weights are much more important\nwhen calculating the embedding.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Cumulative sum of absolute values for the top loadings and bottom loadings as a function of the number of selected genes.](validation_files/figure-html/fig-loadings-top-bottom-1.png){#fig-loadings-top-bottom width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis was using the top loadings, so probably the fuzziness score of a sample\nwith relatively good data will be between 0 and 10 maximum, meaning that\nthey have less than 200 genes missing. When genes are missing, we hope that\nthey are in the bottom part of the loadings, so the fuzziness score\nis as small as possible. \n\nSuppose now that the genes missing in a sample are random. We will calculate\nrandom fuzziness scores based on this to have a feeling of the scores. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of the fuzziness scores from random missing genes. Each color corresponds to a different distribution using a different number of genes.](validation_files/figure-html/fig-fuzziness-random-1.png){#fig-fuzziness-random width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-fuzziness-random shows the results as a function of the number of missing\ngenes. We see that in average, if 200 genes are missing, the fuzziness\nscore is around 5. If less than a 100 genes are missing, the fuzziness\nscore is around 3. In the next section we show how this influences the\nposition where the sample is projected into the embedding.\n\nFinally, we calculate the fuzziness score as a number of top loadings \nmissing. Suppose 150 genes are missing. We will change the proportion\nof genes that are in the top loadings and in the missing list. Since\nthe cumulative sum for PC2 and PC3 are very similar, we focus only on\nPC2.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of the fuzziness scores from 150 random missing genes with different proportions of top loading genes in the list. Each color corresponds to a different distribution using a different proportion of genes.](validation_files/figure-html/fig-fuzziness-random-top-1.png){#fig-fuzziness-random-top width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-fuzziness-random-top shows the fuzziness score with different proportions\nof the top loading genes. We see that they are actually very important when\ncalculating the score. The top loading genes were defined as the top 150 genes\nin the list. So when calculating the number of missing genes it is important\nto check the number of top loadings in the list. \n\n### Validating the score\n\nIn this section we calculate the embeddings with different number of genes\nmissing from a given sample and then plot the original embedding with\nthe newly one. For this\nwe use samples from TCGA. The genes are \nremoved even before the normalization procedure, as they are usually not\navailable there. We select randomly a number of top genes from PC2 and PC3\nto compose the list of missing genes. The proportion of the top loading\ngenes is varied. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### TCGA-OL-A66K-01A-11R-A29R-07\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](validation_files/figure-html/fig-missing-correction-10-1.png){#fig-missing-correction-10 width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### TCGA-GI-A2C9-01A-11R-A21T-07\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](validation_files/figure-html/fig-missing-correction-20-1.png){#fig-missing-correction-20 width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### TCGA-3C-AALK-01A-11R-A41B-07\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](validation_files/figure-html/fig-missing-correction-50-1.png){#fig-missing-correction-50 width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### TCGA-BH-A0BW-01A-11R-A115-07\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](validation_files/figure-html/fig-missing-correction-80-1.png){#fig-missing-correction-80 width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### TCGA-A1-A0SI-01A-11R-A144-07\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](validation_files/figure-html/fig-missing-correction-182-1.png){#fig-missing-correction-182 width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### TCGA-D8-A27L-01A-11R-A16F-07\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](validation_files/figure-html/fig-missing-correction-198-1.png){#fig-missing-correction-198 width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nWhen looking at the figures above, it seems that whenever there are \ngenes missing,\nand the more of top loadings they are, the closer they are to the origin.\nThis makes sense, since PCA is doing a simple linear combination of the loadings.\nThis should be fine to correct, since we can fit a line going through the \norigin and goes through the points above. Then the adjustment will depend\non the number of genes that are missing and are top loadings. The more \nthey are, the more adjustment we will need. \n\nFor the adjustment we only know two things, its current position and \nhow many of the top loadings are missing. Based on this information we\nshould be able to correct the samples. Given the list of genes that are missing,\nwe fit lines that would go through the genes that are missing in the TCGA\nand METABRIC samples. We then try to find the line that is closes to the point.\nAfter performing the fit and the line, we can then move the point to closer\nto the METABRIC and TCGA samples. The point should be close to the line\nand close to points that have the same proportion of top loadings \nmissing.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThese plots show how the fuzziness score might be indicative of how\ngood the embedding will be depending on the number of missing genes. The\nvideo below shows the images for 20 different patients. Notice how all of\nthem are connected to the origin as well.\n\n<iframe width=\"720\" height=\"480\" src=\"../plots/validation/random_loadings.mp4\" align=\"middle\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n## SMC embedding\n\nBy following the same procedures as previously, normalizing and getting\nthe PC coordinates, @fig-smc-cohort shows the biplot of PC1 and PC2\nwhen coloring by cohorts. The samples seem to be well mixed already in\nthe RNA-seq samples. This is probably due to the fact that the SMC cohort\nhas TPM values. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nWhen checking the total number of genes missing, there are only \n4 genes missing. \nAnd as seen before, this number is almost irrelevant, in the sense that\nthe embedding will still be robust and locations will be precise enough.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](validation_files/figure-html/fig-smc-cohort-1.png){#fig-smc-cohort width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs previously, @fig-pca-smc-er-pam50 shows the biplot of PC2 and PC3, \nhighlighting the well mixing of the cohorts. When coloring by ER status,\nsamples are in the right group. Molecular subtype is also correct. This\ncohort is special in the sense that there are more luminal B patients,\nas discussed in the paper. That is why there are more samples in the \nluminal B region.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![PCA embedding of all samples from TCGA, SCANB and METABRIC including the SMC samples on top.
