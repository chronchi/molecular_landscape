Moreover, it is very difficult to compare, molecularly, patients\namong themselves.\n\nThe PREDICT tool [@Wishart2010] provides a tool for practitioners to calculate\nsurvival risks among patients with similar clinical characteristics. This is\nvery important as it shows how to combine data from previous patients to guide\nfurther treatments of new patients. However, no additional information is given,\nsuch as alternative pathways to target or what might be different from other\npatients.\n\nOther tools that help in the clinics are the molecular signatures developed by\ncompanies [@Wallden2015; @vandeVijver2002; @Paik2004]. These signatures are\nintended to be used with ER+ BC patients and depending on the tool, on node\nnegative, post-menopausal women. Based on the set of genes, a risk score is\nassigned or each patient. The score means if a patient would benefit from\nadditional chemotherapy besides the usual endocrine therapy received for either\n5 or 10 years. They also lack the additional information of what are possible\npathways involved and alternative treatments beside chemotherapy.\n\nThere are a few challenges to overcome pathway analysis for patients\nindividually and how to compare patients molecularly. There is no tool that\nallows to integrate patients in a continuous way. Usually integration is a one\nstep procedure and cannot be updated. The usual tools are [@Risso2014;\n@Zhang2020; @Fei2018] and they do not provide batch effect removal for new\nsamples. The only way is to re-run the procedure together with the new sample.\nThe problem of doing this is usually you don't have enough samples to estimate\nbatch effects across groups and therefore correct it.\n\nThis chapter show how to perform PCA projection using samples from different\ndatasets and how new samples can be introduced without retraining of the PCA. We\nfirst introduce the notion of a new normalization that depends on housekeeping\ngenes. After using this new normalization, we proceed with PCA on a subset of\ntwo cohorts using the 1000 most variable genes. We then validate the integration\nwith new samples from a completely different cohort.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n* The library is already synchronized with the lockfile.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Transcriptomics and qPCR normalization\n\nIn this first step we introduce a new normalization. The rational is that we\nneed a normalization procedure that is applied in a single sample only, similar\nto logCPM, but that can be applied to microarray too. In this case, given a set\nof samples, we start by ranking the genes in each sample. We then normalize the\nranking to be between 0 and 1, i.e., we divide by the total number of genes\navailable in that sample. Then, given a list of 50 stable genes across cancer\n[@Bhuva2020], we calculate the average ranking of these genes in the sample and\nthen for each gene in the sample we divide by this average.\n\n### Selecting stable genes\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThe first step is to check what number of these 50 genes are available on TCGA\nand METABRIC, as these datasets will be used for training the PCA projection.\nThe total number of available genes is 44.\n[Table @fig-stable-genes] shows the name of the genes \navailable in TCGA and METABRIC.\n\nNow we select the 1000 most variable genes across METABRIC and TCGA. Reducing\nthe number of genes used when calculating the PCA helps in the future. Several\npublicly available datasets don't have many genes available, therefore reducing\nthe number of genes increases the chances of using this approach in other\ndatasets.\n\nMoreover, the use of a large number of genes is used because if some of them\nare not available. We show in later sections that if some number of stable\ngenes are missing, it will not affect the normalization. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {#fig-stable-genes .cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"htmlwidget-70344ce91f27a090d990\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\" class=\"datatables html-widget\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-70344ce91f27a090d990\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"vertical\":false,\"data\":[[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\",\"8\",\"9\",\"10\",\"11\",\"12\",\"13\",\"14\",\"15\",\"16\",\"17\",\"18\",\"19\",\"20\",\"21\",\"22\",\"23\",\"24\",\"25\",\"26\",\"27\",\"28\",\"29\",\"30\",\"31\",\"32\",\"33\",\"34\",\"35\",\"36\",\"37\",\"38\",\"39\",\"40\",\"41\",\"42\",\"43\",\"44\"],[\"ASB7\",\"C2orf42\",\"CNOT4\",\"RBM45\",\"NRF1\",\"ZNF143\",\"AMMECR1L\",\"SMARCAL1\",\"WDR33\",\"ZNF394\",\"UBE3B\",\"SFSWAP\",\"PPHLN1\",\"SART3\",\"CPSF6\",\"CELF1\",\"IWS1\",\"STAMBP\",\"ERCC3\",\"RBM22\",\"TOR1A\",\"CNOT2\",\"TIAL1\",\"HDAC3\",\"RSRC2\",\"DDX42\",\"TARDBP\",\"RNF10\",\"SRSF1\",\"KHDRBS1\",\"ZNF207\",\"DDB1\",\"SF3B1\",\"SF1\",\"UBE2I\",\"UBE2D3\",\"RAB1A\",\"SRSF3\",\"SFPQ\",\"EIF4H\",\"PCBP1\",\"HNRNPK\",\"DYNLL1\",\"HNRNPA2B1\"]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th> <\\/th>\\n      <th>genes<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"scrollX\":true,\"columnDefs\":[{\"orderable\":false,\"targets\":0}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n\n([Table @fig-stable-genes]) Available stable genes in both TCGA and METABRIC cohorts.\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Calculating the normalization\n\nWe will create subset of the summarised experiment objects to save these\ninformation. Moreover, since a summarized experiment object is being used, we\ncan save the new normalization in the `assays` and the average ranking scores of\nthe housekeeping genes in the column data `colData`.

The\nproliferation marker CCND1 is also highly expressed in all conditions.\n\n### Checking robustness with respect of number of houesekeeping genes available\n\nWhen calculating the normalized data, a total of 44 housekeeping genes were\nused. Sometimes not all of these genes are available, therefore we will\ncalculate the normalization using random subsets of 44 housekeeping genes with\ndifferent random sizes. The sets will have a minimum of 20 genes and maximum of\n44. The sampling of the set size is obtained by using a uniform distribution. We\nfocus just on TCGA for simplicity. The correlation used in this case\nwas the Pearson correlation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Correlation distribution for different subsets of housekeeping genes (HKGs).

All the correlation coefficients are close to 1. This means\nthat if a subset of housekeeping genes are missing it is fine, as the others\nwill compensate.\n\n## Integrating TCGA and METABRIC using PCA\n\nThe next step is creating the framework where we can integrate any patient\nsample and compare each other, at least spatially. The approach is similar to\nsome sort of unsupervised learning, where no labels or groups are specified,\nwhich is something common in algorithms for batch removal. By using PCA in some\nsubset of TCGA and METABRIC, we should learn the idiosyncrasies of the RNA-seq\nand microarray technologies as well as batch effects general to datasets. Since\nthese two cohorts are big ones, we assume that if there are common batch\neffects, they are represented on them.\n\nThe practical steps are: first subselect 1000 samples in total from METABRIC\n**and** TCGA. Train PCA using these 1000 samples. Validate the results by\nprojecting the other samples. In the next section we show how robust the\napproach is when selecting the samples. In the next chapters we validate the\nprojection in unseen cohorts.\n\nIntegrating as laid out here only uses molecular data, therefore patients might\nbe close to each other but they might have very different clinical features.\nThis should always be kept in mind.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThe table below shows the molecular characteristics of the patients selected for\nthe PCA training.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\" lightable-classic\" style='font-family: \"Arial Narrow\", \"Source Sans Pro\", sans-serif; width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;'>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> cohort </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> basal </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> her2 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> lumb </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> luma </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> normal </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> claudin-low </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> metabric </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 73 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 74 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 163 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 224 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 46 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 68 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> tcga </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 70 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 28 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 61 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 177 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 16 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n@fig-pca-embeddings shows the embedding of the two datasets together of the\n1000 samples used for training.
