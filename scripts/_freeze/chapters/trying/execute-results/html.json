Since here we have at least 5 \nmolecular subgroups, we hypothesize we need at least 50 samples to get a \ngood score so we can compare across cohorts. We will try with\ndifferent numbers of samples using TCGA, we start with 10, 25, 50 and\n100 samples and we compare with the scores using the full dataset.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=4800}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=4800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe conclusion we can take here is that depending on the gene set not even 150\nsamples is enough. For some only 25 patients is already enough, such as SET \nER/PR, androgen response, estrogen response early and E2F targets.\n\nCould we mix around 20 samples of SCANB together with more samples from \nTCGA and METABRIC to get the scores?

Here we try to use it on SCANB, METABRIC and TCGA. Moreover,\nwe can start with ABiM, as this dataset has the gold standard ROR score \nobtained from nCounter data.

Here we use METABRIC as it has a long follow-up\nhistory. We start by plotting the embedding of all METABRIC patients that\nhad a followup longer than 10 years and received only ET. We then try to \npredict which patients recurr or not based on the molecular data by\nusing lasso regression. For this we use the package `glmnet` that \nprovides such functionality. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-51-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn general there is no distinction in terms of the molecular\nlandscape among the patients that recurred, both in terms of\nmolecular subtype and position in the molecular landscape. \n\nWe now compare their molecular scores. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-52-1.png){width=1920}\n:::\n:::\n\n \nEven here we don't see much difference.

The thing is, \nproliferation related genes are pretty much present in almost any signature\nand hence all these pathways are correlated to G2M and E2F to some extent \n[@Venet2011].\n\nHere we calculate the pathway scores by using the regressed data and do\nall pairwise comparison of some of the most important pathways to see\ntheir correlations.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-56-1.png){width=1632}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFirst we see that G2M and E2F are encoding basically the same information. \nPI3K AKT MTOR, AR and the Biocarta HER2 and SET ER/PR are all correlated to\nsome extent to proliferation. Surprisingly the two HER2 signaling scores \nare not able to distinguish the HER2 subtype.\nThe SET ER/PR correlation with G2M is possibly explained by the fact that\nthe basal molecular subtype has higher G2M and lower ER signaling compared to\nluminal A and B.\n\n## HER2 and their categories\n\nResearch on the benefits of giving trastuzumab together with antibody drug\nconjugates (ADCs) has been\nshown recently. Patients that are either HER2+ or even considered negative\nbut have some expression of HER2 (1+ and 2+) seem to benefit from ADC + \ntrastuzumab. \n\nHere we first see what are the genes that are leading the differences \nof the HER2 molecular subtype. We query 7 genes that are available in the \nlist of 8+ regions and are in the amplicon region of ERBB2 when this gene\nis amplified (HER2+). \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](trying_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-57-1.png){width=1728}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFirst we notice that ERBB2 is actually not the gene that is driving the \ndifferences, perhaps because when the embedding was learned during the PCA\nthis gene was not used to make the differences between the molecular subtype.\nInstead, the genes that are mostly capturing the difference of the \nHER2-enriched PAM50 molecular subtype are FBXL20, GRB7, MED1 and STARD3. \n\nAnd if we check by HER2 status according to the available datasets.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Regressed gene expression levels and comparison between the HER2 groups.](trying_files/figure-html/fig-her2-genes-1.png){#fig-her2-genes width=1536}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSimilar to what was seen before for ER status you see differences for\nthe HER2+ patients. Note that several of the patients that have gain of\nHER2 have similar gene expression levels to those that have loss\nor are neutral. Moreover, the top genes that are differentiating the \nHER2 status are STARD3, GRB7 and MED1. The differences in HER2 \nare actually very small, but it looks like there is a consistent difference\nstill.\n\nJust before we move on we compare the expression levels before and\nafter regressing the data on SCANB to see if we are not messing\nup too much with the gene expression levels and getting just noise. \n\nThe plot below shows the correlation between ERBB2 FPKM and regressed\ndata and also for GRB7.

The hypothesis here is that\nthe higher the signalling the better the outcome.
